  "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for infantile malignant osteopetrosis (IMO), but is associated with a high incidence of adverse outcomes. In this study, we present our experience with HSCT for IMO patients comparing different types of conditioning regimens.\nThirty-eight patients with IMO (aged from 1 month to 6 years, median 0.66 years) who underwent allogeneic HSCT from 1983 in our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Fludarabine-based conditioning regimens were used in 26 patients and 12 patients were transplanted using other conditioning regimens.\nThe overall survival after conditioning with fludarabine was 96% (25/26) versus 58% (7/12) for the alternative regimens (P = 0.004), with significantly fewer adverse effects including hypercalcemia and veno-occlusive disease of liver. All patients who survive are clinically well.\nWe conclude that fludarabine-based conditioning regimens are safe and effective in patients with IMO, improving morbidity and mortality related to HSCT.",
  "Literature provides 3 studies only investigating the long-term outcome after surgical correction of breast asymmetry. The goal of this study was to analyse from a patient's perspective, which factors influence postoperative satisfaction most.\nAll patients undergoing surgical treatment for breast asymmetry between 2000 and 2009 were included. With help of the visual analogue scale the patients conducted a subjective assessment of their own long-term result using the following parameters: overall satisfaction, symmetry, size, shape, scarring and sensitivity. Anthropometric measurements of the breasts followed.\n51 patients (80% follow-up) were seen 2-11 (mean 5\u00b12.5) years postoperatively. The following mean values were recorded for overall satisfaction 8.31 (\u00b11.91), symmetry 7.86 (\u00b12.25), size 8.42 (\u00b11.93), shape 8.12 (\u00b12.03), scarring 7.82 (\u00b11.94) and sensitivity 7.92 (\u00b12.19). Overall satisfaction increased significantly with good scores for the parameters symmetry [p=0.01] and shape [p=0.048]. Neither size [p=0.46] nor scarring [p=0.69] nor sensitivity [p=0.34] had a statistically significant influence on overall satisfaction. Furthermore, overall satisfaction did not depend on the surgical technique, preoperative size, preoperative asymmetry, age of the patient at time of surgery, period of time between the operation and the assessment, resected weight (absolute and difference between left and right) or on postoperative symmetry of the nipple areola complex.\nIn our patients, long-term overall satisfaction after surgical correction of breast asymmetry was primarily dependent on symmetry and shape. Size, scarring and sensitivity did not have a statistically significant influence on postoperative overall satisfaction. This also applied to preoperative size, preoperative extent of asymmetry, age of the patient at time of surgery, surgical technique and the time span between the operation and the assessment.",
  "Large-scale tumor sequencing projects enabled the identification of many new cancer gene candidates through computational approaches. Here, we describe a general method to detect cancer genes based on significant 3D clustering of mutations relative to the structure of the encoded protein products. The approach can also be used to search for proteins with an enrichment of mutations at binding interfaces with a protein, nucleic acid, or small molecule partner. We applied this approach to systematically analyze the PanCancer compendium of somatic mutations from 4,742 tumors relative to all known 3D structures of human proteins in the Protein Data Bank. We detected significant 3D clustering of missense mutations in several previously known oncoproteins including HRAS, EGFR, and PIK3CA. Although clustering of missense mutations is often regarded as a hallmark of oncoproteins, we observed that a number of tumor suppressors, including FBXW7, VHL, and STK11, also showed such clustering. Beside these known cases, we also identified significant 3D clustering of missense mutations in NUF2, which encodes a component of the kinetochore, that could affect chromosome segregation and lead to aneuploidy. Analysis of interaction interfaces revealed enrichment of mutations in the interfaces between FBXW7-CCNE1, HRAS-RASA1, CUL4B-CAND1, OGT-HCFC1, PPP2R1A-PPP2R5C/PPP2R2A, DICER1-Mg2+, MAX-DNA, SRSF2-RNA, and others. Together, our results indicate that systematic consideration of 3D structure can assist in the identification of cancer genes and in the understanding of the functional role of their mutations.",
  "We report the case of a 43-year-old woman presenting with nocturnal episodes of pain and screaming during sleep starting at age 30. There was no childhood or family history of parasomnia. The events had gradually become more frequent over the years, occurring in the first half of the night within 2 h of sleep onset. There were no triggers, and she had partial amnesia for the events. A diagnosis of adult-onset sleep terrors was made on clinical grounds and supported polysomnographically. Seizures and periodic limb movements were excluded as triggering factors. There was some mild sleep disordered breathing (predominantly non-desaturating hypopnea with a propensity for REM sleep of debatable significance). Imaging of the brain and spine and neurophysiological investigations ruled out lesions, entrapments, or neuropathies as possible causes of pain. Treatment (clonazepam, paroxetine, or gabapentin) was poorly tolerated and made no difference to the nocturnal episodes, while trazodone worsened them. This is the first report of hypnopompic psychic pain in association with a NREM parasomnia. We hypothesize that the pain may represent a sensory hallucination analogous to the more commonly recognized visual NREM parasomnia-associated hypnopompic visual hallucinations and that, as such, it may arise during arousal of the sensory neocortex as confabulatory response.",
  "Age-related cataract is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Therefore, it is important to establish the most effective surgical technique for cataract surgery.\nThe aim of this review is to examine the effects of two types of cataract surgery for age-related cataract: phacoemulsification and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE).\nWe searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2013), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (January 1970 to May 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 13 May 2013.\nWe included randomised controlled trials of phacoemulsification compared to ECCE for age-related cataract.\nTwo authors independently selected and assessed all studies. We defined two primary outcomes: 'good functional vision' (presenting visual acuity of 6/12 or better) and 'poor visual outcome' (best corrected visual acuity of less than 6/60) at three and 12 months after surgery. We also collected data on intra and postoperative complications, and the cost of the procedures.\nWe included 11 trials in this review with a total of 1228 participants, ranging from age 45 to 94. The studies were generally at unclear risk of bias due to poorly reported trial methods. No study reported presenting visual acuity, so we report both uncorrected (UCVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Studies varied in visual acuity assessment methods and time frames at which outcomes were reported. Participants in the phacoemulsification group were more likely to achieve UCVA of 6/12 or more at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.41, two studies, 492 participants) and one year (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.73, one study, 439 participants). People in the phacoemulsification group were also more likely to achieve BCVA of 6/12 or more at three months (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22, four studies, 645 participants) and one year (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.14, one study, 439 participants), but the difference between the two groups was smaller. No trials reported BCVA less than 6/60 but three trials reported BCVA worse than 6/9 and 6/18: there were fewer events of this outcome in the phacoemulsification group than the ECCE group at both the three-month (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55, three studies, 604 participants) and 12-month time points (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.05, one study, 439 participants). Three trials reported posterior capsule rupture: this occurred more commonly in the ECCE group than the phacoemulsification group but small numbers of events mean the true effect is uncertain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.22, three studies, 688 participants). Iris prolapse, cystoid macular oedema and posterior capsular opacification were also higher in the ECCE group than the phacoemulsification group. Phacoemulsification surgical costs were higher than ECCE in two studies. A third study reported similar costs for phacoemulsification and ECCE up to six weeks postoperatively, but following this time point ECCE incurred additional costs due to additional visits, spectacles and laser treatment to achieve a similar outcome.\nRemoving cataract by phacoemulsification may result in a better visual acuity compared to ECCE, with a lower complication rate. The review is currently underpowered to detect differences for rarer outcomes, including poor visual outcome. The lower cost of ECCE may justify its use in a patient population where high-volume surgery is a priority, however, there are a lack of data comparing phacoemulsification and ECCE in lower-income settings.",
  "Phytochemical studies of two Australian Anigozanthos (kangaroo paw) species, A.\u00a0rufus and A.\u00a0pulcherrimus, resulted in the identification of 13 secondary metabolites. 2-Amino-6-O-p-coumarylheptanedioic acid (3) and chalcone-5'-O-(4-O-p-coumaryl)-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (12) are reported as new compounds and are accompanied by nine flavonoids (2, 5-11, 13) and two anthocyanins (1, 4). Compounds 1 and 4 were isolated as red solids from A.\u00a0rufus and are likely responsible for the coloration of the flowers. Compounds 1, 3, and 6 showed weak antimicrobial activities against Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 at concentrations of 52.4, 94.9, and 53.9 \u03bcM, respectively.",
  "The bloom-forming cyanobacteria species Microcystis aeruginosa includes toxic and non-toxic (microcystin-producing) strains. Certain stress conditions stimulate synthesis of microcystin (MCYST) and enhance the binding of the MCYST molecule to proteins. In this quantitative proteomic study, we compared the response of a wild-type toxic strain PCC 7806, an mcyH(-) knockout non-toxic strain, and a naturally occurring non-toxic strain, PCC 7005, after 8 days in low iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) starvation in order to assess the benefit of MCYST synthesis in non-optimal conditions. Fe limitation increased MCYST synthesis and caused an accumulation of phycobilisome proteins and the ferric iron transporter FutA only in the toxic PCC 7806 but not the non-toxic strains. In N starvation, photosynthetic, C and N metabolism proteins were more abundant in the non-toxic strains, as were chaperones and proteases. Significant interaction between nutrient availability and toxicity existed for thioredoxin peroxidase and several thioredoxin-regulated proteins. We propose a competition of MCYST for binding sites in thioredoxin-regulated proteins during oxidative stress (low Fe) but not in growth-limiting conditions (low N). This then leads to differences in the regulation of C:N metabolism in toxic and non-toxic M. aeruginosa in nutrient-replete and nutrient-limited conditions.",
  "The Rh-catalyzed direct annulation of an aldehyde with an alkyne leading to indenone was achieved. The in situ temporal installation of acetylhydrazine enables the annulation of the ortho arene C-H bond with alkynes to form ketone hydrazone. Subsequently, the in situ directing group removal takes place since ketone hydrazone is more susceptible toward hydrolysis than aldehyde hydrazone. Notably, this procedure tolerates a series of functional groups, such as methoxyl, acetylamino, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, methoxycarbonyl, chloro, and bromo groups. ",
  "We performed this study to investigate the prevalences of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a Chinese population with normal weight. We also examined whether fat mass is associated with insulin resistance and MetS in normal-weight individuals. Data were drawn from a cross-sectional study in China. Subjects with diabetes were excluded. The prevalences of insulin resistance and MetS were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed repeated separately for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in both men and women. We also used the combination of BMI and WC to predict insulin resistance and MetS. 8.55 % of normal-weight men and 12.62 % of normal-weight women had insulin resistance. 7.41 % of normal-weight men and 10.24 % of normal-weight women had MetS. WC was associated with incident insulin resistance and MetS independent of BMI in both men and women. BMI was independently associated with incident MetS in women. Normal-weight individuals with insulin resistance and/or MetS are not rare in the Chinese population. Fat mass is associated with insulin resistance and MetS in normal-weight subjects. The current findings support using both BMI and WC in clinical practice.",
  "A common lament is that long-term kidney transplant outcomes remain the same despite improvements in early graft survival. To be fair, progress has been made-in both our understanding of chronic injury and modestly, graft survival. However, we are still a long way from actually solving this important and difficult problem. In this review, we outline recent data supporting the existence of several causes of renal allograft loss, the incidences of which peak at different time points after transplantation. On the basis of this broadened concept of chronic renal allograft injury, we examine the challenges of clinical trial design in long-term studies, including the use of surrogate end points and biomarkers. Finally, we suggest a path forward that, ultimately, may improve long-term renal allograft survival. ",
  "The West Africa Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak has highlighted the need for effective disinfectants capable of reducing viral load in a range of sample types, equipment and settings. Although chlorine-based products are widely used, they can also be damaging to equipment or apparatus that needs continuous use such as aircraft use for transportation of infected people. Two aircraft cleaning solutions were assessed alongside two common laboratory disinfectants in a contact kill assay with EBOV on two aircraft relevant materials representative of a porous and non-porous surface. A decimal log reduction of viral titre of 4 is required for a disinfectant to be deemed effective and two of the disinfectants fulfilled this criteria under the conditions tested. One product, Ardrox 6092, was found to perform similarly to sodium hypochlorite, but as it does not have the corrosive properties of sodium hypochlorite, it could be an alternative disinfectant solution to be used for decontamination of EBOV on sensitive apparatus.

  "The use of laparoscopy for the treatment of gastric cancer suffered some resistance among surgeons around the world, gaining strength in the past decade. However, its oncological safety and technical feasibility remain controversial.\nTo describe the results from the clinical and anatomopathological point of view in the comparative evaluation between the surgical videolaparoscopic and laparotomic treatments of total gastrectomy with linphadenectomy at D2, resection R0.\nRetrospective analyses and comparison data from patients submitted to total gastrectomy with D2 linphadenectomy at a sole institution. The data of 111 patients showed that 64 (57,7%) have been submitted to laparotomic gastrectomy and 47 (42,3%) to gastrectomy entirely performed through videolaparoscopy. All variables related to the surgery, post-operative follow-up and anatomopathologic findings have been evaluated.\nAmong the studied variables, videolaparoscopy has shown a shorter surgical time and a more premature period for the introduction of oral and enteral nourishment than the open surgery. As to the amount of dissected limph nodes, there has been a significant difference towards laparotomy with p=0,014, but the average dissected limph nodes in both groups exceed 25 nodes as recommended by the JAGC. Was not found a significant difference between the studied groups as to age, ASA, type of surgery, need for blood transfusion, stage of the disease, Bormann classification, degree of differentiation, damage of the margins, further complications and death.\nThe total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy performed by laparoscopy presented the same benefits known of laparotomy and with the advantages already established of minimally invasive surgery. It was done with less surgical time, less time for re-introduction of the oral and enteral diets and lower hospitalization time compared to laparotomy, without increasing postoperative complications.",
  "The holistic understanding derived from integrating grain quality and sensory research outcomes in breeding high-quality rice in the light of post-genomics resources has been synthesized. Acceptance of new rice genotypes by producers and consumers hinges not only on their potential for higher yield but recent emphasis has also been on premium-value genotypes that have the ability to satisfy consumer preferences for grain quality. This review article provides insights into how to link grain quality attributes and sensory perception to support breeding superior rice varieties. Recent advances in quality profiling and omics technologies have provided efficient approaches to identify the key genes and biochemical markers involved in rice quality traits. Emphasis has been given to the upcoming area of holistic understanding of grain quality and attributes derived from sensory evaluation to leverage integrative gene discovery strategies that enable breeding programs to efficiently tap the huge genetic diversity in rice for novel genes that enhance rice food quality.",

  "To review all reported methods of preoperative computed tomography (CT) in one patient cohort and to identify which were the strongest to predict postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreatoduodenectomy.\nConsecutive patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy were included if they had unenhanced CT images for review. Eighteen variables and two scores were tested. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were explored.\nPOPF affected 26 of 107 patients (24.3%). Nine variables were significantly related to POPF with pancreatic duct width having the largest area under the ROC curve (AUROC; 0.808, p<0.001). An obese body habitus was associated with POPF with six of nine related variables using data from CT images associated with POPF; of these intra-abdominal wall thickness yielded the largest AUROC (0.713, p=0.001). This corresponded to the finding that body mass index (BMI) was related to POPF (AUROC 0.705, p=0.002). The largest AUROC of all was associated with one of the predictive scores (0.828, p<0.001). Substituting BMI for intra-abdominal wall thickness in this score yielded a non-significant increase to predict POPF (AUROC 0.840, p=0.676). None of the assessments of organ density (in Hounsfield Units) were associated with POPF.\nData from preoperative CT imaging provides valuable information regarding a patient's risk of POPF. Obesity as assessed by CT images strongly relates to POPF, but the largest single risk factor for POPF is a narrow pancreatic duct.",
  "The therapeutic effect of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease (CD) and the epidemiological associations between diet and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) implicate diet in IBD causation. There is little evidence, however, to support specific dietary changes and patients often receive contradictory advice.\nTo review the literature on the impacts of diet on IBD causation and activity to produce guidance based on 'best available evidence'.\nReview of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'.\nEnteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers. Foods tolerated in sustained remission may not be tolerated following relapse. Some evidence supports vitamin D supplementation. In ulcerative colitis (UC), evidence is weaker, but high intakes of meat and margarine correlate with increased UC incidence and high meat intake also correlates with increased likelihood of relapse.\nThere is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.",
  "Immunostimulatory antibodies entering the clinic create challenge in terms of not only pharmacodynamics for monitoring anticipated mechanisms but also predetermining cytotoxicity. We show the use of ex vivo whole-blood samples to predict the activation requirements, cytokine signature, and adverse events of an anti-human-CD40 chimeric IgG1 antibody, ChiLob 7/4. Assessments were initially undertaken on human myeloid (mDC1) and plasmacytoid (pDC) dendritic cells, in which an absolute need for cross-linking was shown through the upregulation of activation markers CD83 and CCR7. Subsequent cytokine secretion evaluations of ex vivo whole blood showed the cross-linked antibody-induced increases in MIP1\u03b2, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-12, TNF\u03b1, and IL-6. This cytokine signature compared favorably with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in which levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were significantly higher, suggesting a less intense proinflammatory response and possible modified cytokine release syndrome when used in human trials. Following first-in-human use of this agent within a dose escalation study, in vivo evaluations of dendritic cell activation and secreted cytokines closely matched the predetermined immunomonitoring endpoints. Patients showed a comparable pattern of MIP1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-12 secretion, but no TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were identified. Mild symptoms relating to a cytokine release syndrome were seen at an equivalent dosage to that observed for dendritic cell activation and cytokine release. In summary, ChiLob 7/4 induces a distinctive pattern of dendritic cell activation and cytokine secretion in ex vivo assays that can be predictive of in vivo responses. Such preclinical approaches to monoclonal antibody evaluation may inform both the starting dosages and the anticipated cytokine release events that could occur, providing a valuable adjunct for future first-in-human assessments of immunostimulatory antibodies.",
  "Anemia is frequent in patients with cardiovascular disease and is often characterized as the fifth cardiovascular risk factor. It is considered to develop due to a complex interaction of iron deficiency, cytokine production and impaired renal function, although other factors, such as blood loss, may also contribute. Unfortunately, treatment of anemia in cardiovascular disease lacks clear targets and specific therapy is not defined. Treatment with erythropoietin-stimulating agents in combination with iron is the basic strategy but clear guidelines are not currently available. This review aims to clarify poorly investigated and defined issues concerning the relation of anemia and cardiovascular risk--in particular in patients with acute coronary syndromes and chronic heart failure--as well as the current therapeutic strategies in these clinical conditions.",
  "A highly electroactive bio-nanohybrid film of polypyrrole (PPy)-Nafion (Nf)-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (fMWCNTs) nanocomposite was prepared on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by a facile one-step electrochemical polymerization technique followed by chitosan-glucose oxidase (CH-GOx) immobilization on its surface to achieve a high-performance glucose biosensor. The as-fabricated nanohybrid composite provides high surface area for GOx immobilization and thus enhances the enzyme-loading efficiency. The structural characterization revealed that the PPy-Nf-fMWCNTs nanocomposite films were uniformly formed on GCE and after GOx immobilization, the surface porosities of the film were decreased due to enzyme encapsulation inside the bio-nanohybrid composite materials. The electrochemical behavior of the fabricated biosensor was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and amperometry measurements. The results indicated an excellent catalytic property of bio-nanohybrid film for glucose detection with improved sensitivity of 2860.3\u03bcAmM(-1)cm(-2), the linear range up to 4.7mM (R(2)=0.9992), and a low detection limit of 5\u03bcM under a signal/noise (S/N) ratio of 3. Furthermore, the resulting biosensor presented reliable selectivity, better long-term stability, good repeatability, reproducibility, and acceptable measurement of glucose concentration in real serum samples. Thus, this fabricated biosensor provides an efficient and highly sensitive platform for glucose sensing and can open up new avenues for clinical applications. ",
  "The accuracy of digital impressions greatly influences their clinical viability in implant restorations. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of gypsum models acquired from the conventional implant impression to digitally milled models created from direct digitalization by three-dimensional analysis.\nThirty gypsum and 30 digitally milled models, impressed directly from a reference model, were prepared. The models and reference model were scanned by a laboratory scanner, and 30 surface tessellation language datasets from each group were imported to an inspection software program. The datasets were aligned to the reference dataset by a repeated best-fit algorithm, and 10 specified contact locations of interest were measured in mean volumetric deviations. The areas were pooled by cusps, fossae, interproximal contacts, horizontal and vertical axes of implant position and angulation. The pooled areas were statistically analysed by comparing each group to the reference model to investigate the mean volumetric deviations accounting for accuracy and standard deviations for precision.\nMilled models from digital impressions had comparable accuracy to gypsum models from conventional impressions. However, differences in fossae and vertical displacement of the implant position from the gypsum and digitally milled models compared to the reference model exhibited statistical significance (P < 0.001, P = 0.020, respectively).\nMilled models from digital impression are comparable to gypsum models from conventional impression.",

We also include a brief review of the literature. ",
  "Parotid gland tumor surgery sometimes leads to facial nerve paralysis. Malignant more than benign tumors determine nerve function preoperatively, while postoperative observations based on clinical, histological and neurophysiological studies have not been reported in detail. The aims of this pilot study were evaluation and correlations of histological properties of tumor (its size and location) and clinical and neurophysiological assessment of facial nerve function pre- and post-operatively (1 and 6 months). Comparative studies included 17 patients with benign (n = 13) and malignant (n = 4) tumors. Clinical assessment was based on House-Brackmann scale (H-B), neurophysiological diagnostics included facial electroneurography [ENG, compound muscle action potential (CMAP)], mimetic muscle electromyography (EMG) and blink-reflex examinations (BR). Mainly grade I of H-B was recorded both pre- (n = 13) and post-operatively (n = 12) in patients with small (1.5-2.4 cm) benign tumors located in superficial lobes. Patients with medium size (2.5-3.4 cm) malignant tumors in both lobes were scored at grade I (n = 2) and III (n = 2) pre- and mainly VI (n = 4) post-operatively. CMAP amplitudes after stimulation of mandibular marginal branch were reduced at about 25 % in patients with benign tumors after surgery. In the cases of malignant tumors CMAPs were not recorded following stimulation of any branch. A similar trend was found for BR results. H-B and ENG results revealed positive correlations between the type of tumor and surgery with facial nerve function. Neurophysiological studies detected clinically silent facial nerve neuropathy of mandibular marginal branch in postoperative period. Needle EMG, ENG and BR examinations allow for the evaluation of face muscles reinnervation and facial nerve regeneration.",
  "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) may instigate mixed cryoglobulinemia; the most significant accompanying kidney lesion is type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, usually occurring in the context of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia. Additionally, recent data support a link between HCV infection and proteinuria in population-based studies, raising the possibility that kidney diseases associated with HCV may be more common than previously thought. A number of strategies have been used to treat HCV-related glomerulonephritis, including antiviral agents, immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents, and plasma exchange. Limited but encouraging data about the utility of antiviral treatment in the setting of HCV-associated glomerulonephritis exist, with one pooled analysis noting a sustained viral response of 42%, albeit with significant heterogeneity. Immunosuppressive therapy may be most useful for cryoglobulinemic kidney disease, with individualized approaches considered for the treatment of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis based on the level of proteinuria and kidney failure. Of note, rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that blocks CD20 receptors on B cells, has been reported to be effective for the treatment of mixed cryoglobulinemia symptoms, including glomerulonephritis.",
  "What happens when an animal is injured and loses important structures? Some animals simply heal the wound, whereas others are able to regenerate lost parts. In this study, we report a previously unidentified strategy of self-repair, where moon jellyfish respond to injuries by reorganizing existing parts, and rebuilding essential body symmetry, without regenerating what is lost. Specifically, in response to arm amputation, the young jellyfish of Aurelia aurita rearrange their remaining arms, recenter their manubria, and rebuild their muscular networks, all completed within 12 hours to 4 days. We call this process symmetrization. We find that symmetrization is not driven by external cues, cell proliferation, cell death, and proceeded even when foreign arms were grafted on. Instead, we find that forces generated by the muscular network are essential. Inhibiting pulsation using muscle relaxants completely, and reversibly, blocked symmetrization. Furthermore, we observed that decreasing pulse frequency using muscle relaxants slowed symmetrization, whereas increasing pulse frequency by lowering the magnesium concentration in seawater accelerated symmetrization. A mathematical model that describes the compressive forces from the muscle contraction, within the context of the elastic response from the mesoglea and the ephyra geometry, can recapitulate the recovery of global symmetry. Thus, self-repair in Aurelia proceeds through the reorganization of existing parts, and is driven by forces generated by its own propulsion machinery. We find evidence for symmetrization across species of jellyfish (Chrysaora pacifica, Mastigias sp., and Cotylorhiza tuberculata). ",
  "The purposes of this study were to measure intraobserver and interobserver repeatability of quantitative elastography using an acoustic coupler for the Achilles tendon, to compare elastographic values among different age groups, and to assess the correlation between quantitative and conventional qualitative measurements.\nOne hundred asymptomatic Achilles tendons of 50 volunteers were examined. For quantitative elastography, the strain value of the tendon was divided by that of the acoustic coupler with a known Young modulus, and the strain ratio was calculated. B-mode image assessment and qualitative elastography were also performed. Intraobserver repeatability and interobserver repeatability of strain ratio measurements were calculated. The strain ratios were compared among age groups by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Additionally, strain ratios for each B-mode grade and qualitative elastographic grade were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test.\nIntraobserver repeatability intraclass correlation coefficient (1, 3) values were 0.87 and 0.93, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the observers' measurements was 0.61. The strain ratio for the 30s age group was 0.27, which was significantly lower than the values for the other age groups (P < .001). Although 97 of 100 tendons were normal on B-mode evaluations, 36 of the 97 tendons were degenerated on qualitative elastography and also had higher strain ratio values than normal tendons.\nQuantitative elastography using an acoustic coupler is a reproducible technique for measuring the elasticity of the Achilles tendon. It may detect early tendon degeneration that is not depicted on B-mode imaging.",
  "Assessments of risk to a population group resulting from internal exposure to a particular radionuclide can be used to assess the reliability of the appropriate International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) dose coefficient, E(50), used as a radiation protection device for the specified exposure pathway. An estimate of the uncertainty on the risk is important for informing judgements on reliability. This paper describes the application of parameter uncertainty analysis to quantify uncertainties resulting from internal exposures to radioisotopes of the alkaline earth metals, (90)Sr and (226)Ra, by members of the UK public. The study derives uncertainties in biokinetic model parameter values to calculate the distributions of the effective dose per unit intake using the ICRP Publication 60 formalism. The distributions are used to infer the uncertainty on the mean effective dose per unit intake to inform the derivation of uncertainty factors (UF) for the appropriate ICRP Publication 72 dose coefficients. Here, a UF indicates a 95 % probability that the best estimate of risk per unit intake is within a factor, UF, of the nominal risk associated with the appropriate ICRP dose coefficient, E(50), with respect to uncertainties in the biokinetic model parameter values. Ingestion: it is assumed that exposure occurs through the ingestion of radionuclides present in food and water. The results for both radionuclides suggest a UF of within 3 for all age groups, with median values close to the ICRP values. Inhalation: it is assumed that environmental exposure to radium occurs primarily due to insoluble forms present in fly ash discharged from coal-fired power stations; for strontium, exposure is assumed to occur due to residual aerosols produced as a result of atmospheric nuclear testing and nuclear reactor accidents. The results suggest a UF of around 3 and 6 for inhalation of (90)Sr and (226)Ra, respectively, by members of the public. ",
  "Ultrasonic irradiation was applied to improve the desorption of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) in crude oil from three types of soil. Soil A was an Ottawa sand, while soil B and soil C were fine soils that contained 27.6% and 55.3% of silt and clay contents, respectively. It was found that the ultrasonic desorption was highly related to soil types, with the highest and the lowest desorption occurring in coarse soil (i.e., soil A) and finer soil (i.e., soil C), respectively. Under the experimental conditions, the maximum ultrasonic desorption enhancement of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) reached 22% for soil A, 61% for soil B, and 49% for soil C, respectively. The maximum enhancement on the F2 (n-C10 to n-C16), F3 (n-C16 to n-C34), and F4 (n-C34 to n-C50) fractions of PHC reached 91, 44, and 51% for soil B, and 90, 38, and 31% for soil C, respectively. The desorption enhancement also illustrated an increasing trend with initial soil TPH concentration.",
  "The CYP2C9 IVS8-109T allele was recently found to be more frequent among Swedish individuals, who have the highest losartan metabolic ratio (MR; losartan:E-3174). Thus, the influence of the CYP2C9 IVS8-109A>T polymorphism on the losartan MR was evaluated among healthy Ecuadorians. In addition, the frequency of the CYP2C9 IVS8-109A>T polymorphism was determined.\nAmong CYP2C9-homozygous wild-types, those with the CYP2C9 IVS8-109T/T versus A/A genotypes had a lower MR (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the frequency of the CYP2C9 IVS8-109T variant was lower in Ecuadorians (21.4%; p < 0.001) than in populations from Sweden or Asia (ranging from 32 to 46%).\nIn this Ecuadorian population, the CYP2C9 IVS8-109T allele was associated with an increased CYP2C9 hydroxylation capacity. Further investigation needs to be carried out in order to clarify the relevance of the SNP of CYP2C9 IVS8-109A>T on losartan hydroxylation across populations and its potential implications in CYP2C9 activity.",
  "A broad analysis of adrenal gland-derived 19-carbon (C19) steroids has not been reported. This is the first study that uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to quantify 9 C19 steroids (androgens and their precursors), estrone, and estradiol in the adrenal vein (AV) of women, before and after ACTH stimulation.\nThe objective of this study was to define the adrenal androgen metabolome in women before and after ACTH infusion.\nThis was a retrospective study.\nSeven women, aged 50.4 \u00b1 5.4 years, with suspected diagnosis of an adrenal aldosterone-producing adenoma were included in the study.\nAV and iliac serum samples were collected before and after administration of ACTH (15 minutes). AV samples were analyzed using for concentrations of 9 unconjugated C19 steroids, estrone, and estradiol. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) was quantified by radioimmunoassay.\nAV levels of DHEA-S were the highest among the steroids measured. The most abundant unconjugated C19 steroids in AV were 11\u03b2-hydroxyandrostenedione (11OHA), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenedione (A4). ACTH significantly increased the adrenal output of 9 of the 12 steroids that were measured. ACTH increased the mean AV concentration of DHEA-S by 5-fold, DHEA by 21-fold, A4 by 7-fold, and 11OHA by 5-fold. 11\u03b2-Hydroxytestosterone and testosterone were found to be potent androgen receptor agonists when tested with an androgen-responsive cell reporter model.\nThe current study indicates that the adrenal gland secretes primarily 3 weak androgens, namely DHEA, 11OHA, and A4. Active androgens, including testosterone and 11\u03b2-hydroxytestosterone, are also produced but to a lesser degree.",
  "Enormous progress has been made in paediatric heart transplantation since the first unsuccessful effort by Kantrowitz in 1967. Early reports of children undergoing heart transplantation showed alarmingly high perioperative mortality rates of 25-60%, with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) representing a particularly high-risk subset compared with cardiomyopathy. Many of these early failures were related to poor patient selection, suboptimal immunosuppression and technical problems. We learned a great deal from these earlier difficulties. Presently, with more refined techniques, better-defined patient selection criteria, excellent graft rejection monitoring and optimal immunosuppression, the ISHLT 2011 registry reported a 10-year survival rate of 60% for patients transplanted for end-stage CHD and >70% for those transplanted for cardiomyopathy. The technical dilemmas in complex CHD were overcome by surgical ingenuity and creativity, innovative solutions and careful surgical planning, adapting the complex recipient anatomy to the normal donor anatomy. The miniaturized Berlin Heart pulsatile ventricular assist devices in children as a bridge to transplantation have revolutionized treatment and become a significant contribution in heart-failure therapy. The intramyocardial electrogram and echocardiographic strain rate imaging have been employed as non-invasive techniques of rejection monitoring. Immunosuppressive drugs have a major impact on the development and progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, the main cause of cardiac allograft loss and a leading cause of mortality after the first year post-transplantation. The questions of whether a transplanted heart in a newborn grows to adult size along with the child and whether the dimensional cardiac growth allows adequate function over time have been largely answered in our previous investigations. As more transplanted children reach adulthood, concerns about their life expectancy when they have reached 10 years of life post-transplant are raised, particularly with respect to establishing partnerships and families, their ability to earn a living and the fulfilment of personal life perspectives. Some heart-transplanted patients require retransplantation to remain alive. The disparity between the demand for and supply of donor hearts makes retransplantation an ethical issue. We 'do not refuse' any patient who needs retransplantation. Mechanical circulatory support devices for long-term use are now largely available to accommodate such cases.",
  "Standard practice for immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation is quadruple therapy using antibody induction, low-dose tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. Long-term steroid intake significantly increases cardiovascular risk factors with negative effects on the outcome, especially post-transplantation diabetes associated with morbidity and mortality. In this trial, we examined the efficacy and safety parameters of rapid steroid withdrawal after induction therapy with either rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rabbit ATG) or basiliximab in immunologically low-risk patients during the first year after kidney transplantation.\nIn this open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned renal transplant recipients in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either basiliximab induction with low-dose tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance therapy (arm A), rapid corticosteroid withdrawal on day 8 (arm B), or rapid corticosteroid withdrawal on day 8 after rabbit ATG (arm C). The study was done in 21 centres across Germany. Only participants aged between 18 and 75 years with a low immunological risk who were scheduled to receive a single-organ renal transplant from either a living donor or a deceased donor were considered for enrolment. Patients receiving a second renal transplant were eligible, provided that the first allograft was not lost due to acute rejection within the first year after transplantation. Donor and recipient had to be ABO compatible. Grafts with pre-transplant existing donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies were not eligible and the recipients had to have a panel-reactive antibody concentration of 30% or less. Pregnant women and nursing mothers were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint was the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) at 12 months. All analyses were done by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00724022.\nBetween Aug 7, 2008, and Nov 30, 2013, 615 patients were randomly assigned to arm A (206), arm B (189), and arm C (192). BPAR rates were not reduced by rabbit ATG (9\u00b79%) compared with either treatment arm A (11\u00b72%) or B (10\u00b76%; A versus C: p=0\u00b775, B versus C p=0\u00b787). As a secondary endpoint, rapid steroid withdrawal reduced post-transplantation diabetes in arm B to 24% and in arm C to 23% compared with 39% in control arm A (A versus B and C: p=0\u00b70004). Patient survival (94\u00b77% in arm A, 97\u00b74% in arm B, and 96\u00b79% in arm C) and censored graft survival (96\u00b71% in arm A, 96\u00b78% in arm B, and 95\u00b78% in arm C) after 12 months were excellent and equivalent in all arms. Safety parameters such as infections or the incidence of post-transplantation malignancies did not differ between the study arms.\nRabbit ATG did not show superiority over basiliximab induction for the prevention of BPAR after rapid steroid withdrawal within 1 year after renal transplantation. Nevertheless, rapid steroid withdrawal after induction therapy for patients with a low immunological risk profile can be achieved without loss of efficacy and is advantageous in regard to post-transplantation diabetes incidence.\nInvestigator Initiated Trial; financial support by Astellas Pharma GmbH, Sanofi, and Roche Pharma AG.",
  "The autosomal recessive white matter disorder LBSL (leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation) is caused by mutations in DARS2, coding for mtAspRS (mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase). Generally, patients are compound heterozygous for mutations in DARS2. Many different mutations have been identified in patients, including several missense mutations. In the present study, we have examined the effects of missense mutations found in LBSL patients on the expression, enzyme activity, localization and dimerization of mtAspRS, which is important for understanding the cellular defect underlying the pathogenesis of the disease. Nine different missense mutations were analysed and were shown to have various effects on mtAspRS properties. Several mutations have a direct effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme; others have an effect on protein expression or dimerization. Most mutations have a clear impact on at least one of the properties of mtAspRS studied, probably resulting in a small contribution of the missense variants to the mitochondrial aspartylation activity in the cell.",
  "Two new trypsin inhibitors, nostosin A (1) and B (2), were isolated from a hydrophilic extract of Nostoc sp. strain FSN, which was collected from a paddy field in the Golestan Province of Iran. Nostosins A (1) and B (2) are composed of three subunits, 2-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanoic acid (Hhpba), L-Ile, and L-argininal (1) or argininol (2). Nostosins A (1) and B (2) exhibited IC50 values of 0.35 and 55 \u03bcM against porcine trypsin, respectively, suggesting that the argininal aldehyde group plays a crucial role in the efficient inhibition of trypsin. Molecular docking of nostosin A (1) (449 Da), leupeptin (426 Da, IC50 0.5 \u03bcM), and spumigin E (610 Da, IC50 < 0.1 \u03bcM) with trypsin suggested prominent binding similarity between nostosin A (1) and leupeptin but only partial binding similarity with spumigin E. The number of hydrogen bonds between ligands and trypsin increased according to the length and size of the ligand molecule, and the docking affinity values followed the measured IC50 values. Nostosin A (1) is the first highly potent three-subunit trypsin inhibitor with potency comparable to the known commercial trypsin inhibitor leupeptin. These findings expand the known diversity of short-chain linear peptide protease inhibitors produced by cyanobacteria.",
  "There are several published studies examining the major complications (bleeding and perforation) of colon endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). However, little is known about the other complications, such as post-ESD coagulation syndrome (CS). The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence and the clinical features of CS after colon ESD.\nThere were 183 cases treated with ESD for either a colorectal laterally spreading tumor or a polypoid mass in Konkuk University Medical Center. There were 151 cases enrolled in this study after excluding patients with perforation, bleeding, nonlifting sign, or nonneoplastic lesions. Patients with a fever above 37.7 \u00b0C, abdominal pain, and localized tenderness after ESD without macro- or microperforation, regardless of the symptoms of peritoneal irritation, were deemed as showing post-colon ESD CS.\nThere were 151 cases enrolled in this study, and 13 patients (8.6 %) showed CS after colorectal ESD. There were no differences in the demographic and endoscopic characteristics between the patients with CS and those without CS. The mean hospitalization stay was 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 days longer in the CS (+) group (6.9 \u00b1 1.9 days) than that in the CS (-) group (3.9 \u00b1 1.6 days) (p = 0.001). All patients with CS were treated with conservative, nonsurgical management, such as fasting and intravenous antibiotics.\nThe rate of post-ESD CS was less than 9 % in this study. Although CS occurred, all of the patients with CS showed a favorable progression within 1 week.",
  "The concern about the harmful effects caused by synthetic pesticides has led to the search for safe and ecological alternatives for pest control. In this context, the neem tree (Azadirachta indica) stands out due to its repellent properties and effects on various arthropods, including ticks. For this reason, this study aimed to demonstrate the potential of neem as a control method for Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, important vectors of diseases in the veterinary point of view. For this, R. sanguineus semi-engorged females were subjected to treatment with neem seed oil enriched with azadirachtin, its main compound, and ovaries were assessed by means of morphological techniques in conventional light microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Neem demonstrated a clear dose-dependent effect in the analyzed samples. The observed oocytes presented, especially in the groups treated with higher concentrations of neem oil, obvious signs of cytoplasmic disorganization, cellular vacuolization, nuclear and nucleolar irregularity, dilation in mitochondrial cristae, alterations in mitochondrial matrix, and swelling of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Intracellular microorganisms were observed in all analyzed groups, reinforcing the importance of ticks in the transmission of pathogens. A greater quantity of microorganisms was noted as the concentration of neem increased, indicating that the damaged oocytes may be more susceptible for their development. Such morphological alterations may promote future damages in reproductive performance of these animals and demonstrate the potential of neem seed oil for the control of R. sanguineus ticks, paving the way for new, cheaper, and safer methods of control.",
  "Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by reversible airway obstruction, chronic inflammation and airway remodeling. Phenotyping and/or endotyping can lead to a more personalized treatment strategy, improving the efficacy of novel drugs. Atopic asthma is associated with high levels of Th2 cells, implicated in a number of inflammatory responses. Differentiation of these cells from naive T cells occurs primarily via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Targeting this pathway through inhibition of activating cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) and their receptors, the JAKs or the STATs, has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on asthma pathology. There are a number of novel drugs currently in development, which target various pathway components; these include both biologics and small molecules at various stages of development. ",
  "Just as there is a range of paediatric imaging techniques available during life, a similar repertoire is available as part of the foetal and perinatal postmortem examination. In this article, we review the literature regarding the diagnostic utility of postmortem radiography, US, CT and MRI in this clinical setting. There is limited direct evidence on the diagnostic utility of any of these techniques, apart from postmortem MRI, which when combined with other noninvasive investigations, has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for many foetal postmortem diagnoses. The main disadvantages of postmortem MRI include the longer duration of imaging, the need for appropriate training in the interpretation of normal postmortem changes, and possible non-diagnostic imaging examinations in early gestation foetuses. As less-invasive autopsy becomes increasingly available, the true utility of these techniques will evolve, and clinical guidelines for maximal diagnostic yield can be developed. ",

  "Osteocytes are proposed to be the mechanosensory cells that translate mechanical loading into biochemical signals during the process of bone adaptation. The lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been reported to play a role in the mechanotransduction process of blood vessels and also in the dynamic control of bone mineral homeostasis. Nevertheless, the potential role of S1P in bone mechanotransduction has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we hypothesized that a S1P cascade is involved in the activation of osteocytes in response to loading-induced oscillatory fluid flow (OFF) in bone. MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells express the necessary components of a functional S1P cascade. To examine the involvement of S1P signaling in osteocyte mechanotransduction, we applied OFF (1 Pa, 1 Hz) to osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells under conditions where the S1P signaling pathway was modulated. We found that decreased endogenous S1P levels significantly suppressed the OFF-induced intracellular calcium response. Addition of extracellular S1P to MLO-Y4 cells enhanced the synthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) under static cells and amplified OFF-induced PGE2 release. The stimulatory effect of OFF on the gene expression levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator for nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) was S1P dependent. Furthermore, the S1P2 receptor subtype was shown to be involved in OFF-induced PGE2 synthesis and release, as well as down-regulation of RANKL/OPG gene expression ratio. In summary, our data suggest that S1P cascade is involved in OFF-induced mechanotransduction in MLO-Y4 cells and that extracellular S1P exerts its effect partly through S1P2 receptors.",
  "Amyloid precursor protein (APP), commonly associated with Alzheimer disease, is upregulated and distributes evenly along the injured axons, and therefore, also known as a marker of demyelinating axonal injury and axonal degeneration. However, the physiological distribution and function of APP along myelinated axons was unknown. We report that APP aggregates at nodes of Ranvier (NOR) in the myelinated central nervous system (CNS) axons but not in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). At CNS NORs, APP expression co-localizes with tenascin-R and is flanked by juxtaparanodal potassium channel expression demonstrating that APP localized to NOR. In APP-knockout (KO) mice, nodal length is significantly increased, while sodium channels are still clustered at NORs. Moreover, APP KO and APP-overexpressing transgenic (APP TG) mice exhibited a decreased and an increased thickness of myelin in spinal cords, respectively, although the changes are limited in comparison to their littermate WT mice. The thickness of myelin in APP KO sciatic nerve also increased in comparison to that in WT mice. Our observations indicate that APP acts as a novel component at CNS NORs, modulating nodal formation and has minor effects in promoting myelination. ",
  "Cranial sensory placodes derive from discrete patches of the head ectoderm and give rise to numerous sensory structures. During gastrulation, a specialized \"neural border zone\" forms around the neural plate in response to interactions between the neural and nonneural ectoderm and signals from adjacent mesodermal and/or endodermal tissues. This zone subsequently gives rise to two distinct precursor populations of the peripheral nervous system: the neural crest and the preplacodal ectoderm (PPE). The PPE is a common field from which all cranial sensory placodes arise (adenohypophyseal, olfactory, lens, trigeminal, epibranchial, otic). Members of the Six family of transcription factors are major regulators of PPE specification, in partnership with cofactor proteins such as Eya. Six gene activity also maintains tissue boundaries between the PPE, neural crest, and epidermis by repressing genes that specify the fates of those adjacent ectodermally derived domains. As the embryo acquires anterior-posterior identity, the PPE becomes transcriptionally regionalized, and it subsequently becomes subdivided into specific placodes with distinct developmental fates in response to signaling from adjacent tissues. Each placode is characterized by a unique transcriptional program that leads to the differentiation of highly specialized cells, such as neurosecretory cells, sensory receptor cells, chemosensory neurons, peripheral glia, and supporting cells. In this review, we summarize the transcriptional and signaling factors that regulate key steps of placode development, influence subsequent sensory neuron specification, and discuss what is known about mutations in some of the essential PPE genes that underlie human congenital syndromes.",
  "The ability to regulate gene expression is of central importance for the adaptability of living organisms to changes in their external and internal environment. At the transcriptional level, binding of transcription factors (TFs) in the promoter region can modulate the transcription rate, hence making TFs central players in gene regulation. For some model organisms, information about the locations and identities of discovered TF binding sites have been collected in continually updated databases, such as RegulonDB for the well-studied case of E. coli. In order to reveal the general principles behind the binding-site arrangement and function of these regulatory architectures we propose a random promoter architecture model that preserves the overall abundance of binding sites to identify overrepresented binding site configurations. This model is analogous to the random network model used in the study of genetic network motifs, where regulatory motifs are identified through their overrepresentation with respect to a \"randomly connected\" genetic network. Using our model we identify TF pairs which coregulate operons in an overrepresented fashion, or individual TFs which act at multiple binding sites per promoter by, for example, cooperative binding, DNA looping, or through multiple binding domains. We furthermore explore the relationship between promoter architecture and gene expression, using three different genome-wide protein copy number censuses. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no systematic correlation between the number of activator and repressor binding sites regulating a gene and the level of gene expression. A position-weight-matrix model used to estimate the binding affinity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the promoters of activated and repressed genes suggests that this lack of correlation might in part be due to differences in basal transcription levels, with repressed genes having a higher basal activity level. This quantitative catalogue relating promoter architecture and function provides a first step towards genome-wide predictive models of regulatory function. ",
  "Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) modulate protein function, trafficking, and interactions. Many PTMs ubiquitously occurs on hundreds and thousands of proteins, which makes cellular imaging of the PTM state of a specific protein like looking for a needle in a haystack. A proximity-enabled strategy, which exploits the spatial proximity between the PTM and the modified protein, has emerged as a valuable tool for protein-specific imaging of PTMs in single cells and tissue sections. The protein and the PTM are dually labeled with two distinct tags, which enable the generation of the nanometer proximity-dependent fluorescent signals for visualization. Herein, we review recent advances in the methodological developments and the applications of the proximity-enabled protein-specific imaging in studying phosphorylation, glycosylation, and lipidation.

  "The radiation of a lineage and its rise to ecological dominance are distinct phenomena and driven by different processes. For example, paleoecological data has been used to show that the Cretaceous angiosperm radiation did not coincide with their rise to dominance. Using a phylogenetic approach, we here explored the evolution of C4 grasses and evaluated whether the diversification of this group and its rise to ecological dominance in the late Miocene were decoupled.\nWe assembled a matrix including 675 grass species of the PACMAD clade and 2784 characters (ITS and ndhF) to run a molecular dating analysis using three fossils as reference calibrations. We coded species as C3 vs. C4 and reconstructed ancestral states under maximum likelihood. We used the program BiSSE to test whether rates of diversification are correlated with photosynthetic pathway and whether the radiation of C4 lineages preceded or coincided with their rise to ecological dominance from \u223c10 Ma.\nC4 grass lineages first originated around 35 Ma at the time of the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Accelerated diversification of C4 lineages did not coincide with their rise to ecological dominance.\nC4-dominated grasslands have expanded only since the Late Miocene and Pliocene. The initial diversification of their biotic elements can be tracked back as far as the Eocene-Oligocene transition. We suggest that shifts in taxonomic diversification and ecological dominance were stimulated by different factors, as in the case of the early angiosperms in the Cretaceous.",
  "A longitudinal study was performed to (i) investigate the continuity of shedding of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in dogs without clinical signs, (ii) identify dominant plasmid-mediated ESBL genes, and (iii) quantify ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in feces. Fecal samples from 38 dogs were collected monthly for 6 months. Additional samples were collected from 7 included dogs on a weekly basis for 6 weeks. Numbers of CFU per gram of feces for non-wild-type Enterobacteriaceae were determined by using MacConkey agar supplemented with 1 mg/liter cefotaxime (MCC), and those for total Enterobacteriaceae were determined by using MacConkey agar. Cefotaxime-resistant isolates were screened by PCR and sequence analysis for the presence of bla(CTX-M), bla(CMY), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), and bla(TEM) gene families. Bacterial species were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. PCR-negative isolates were tested by a double-disk synergy test for enhanced AmpC expression. A total of 259 samples were screened, and 126 samples were culture positive on MCC, resulting in 352 isolates, 327 of which were Escherichia coli. Nine dogs were continuously positive during this study, and 6 dogs were continuously negative. Monthly or weekly shifts in fecal shedding were observed for 23 dogs. Genotyping showed a large variety of ESBL genes and gene combinations at single and multiple consecutive sampling moments. The ESBL genes bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(SHV-12), and bla(CMY-2) were most frequently found. The mean number of CFU of non-wild-type Enterobacteriaceae was 6.11 \u00d7 10(8) CFU/g feces. This study showed an abundance of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in dogs in the Netherlands, mostly in high concentrations. Fecal shedding was shown to be highly dynamic over time, which is important to consider when studying ESBL epidemiology.",
  "Cell movement has essential functions in development, immunity, and cancer. Various cell migration patterns have been reported, but no general rule has emerged so far. Here, we show on the basis of experimental data in vitro and in vivo that cell persistence, which quantifies the straightness of trajectories, is robustly coupled to cell migration speed. We suggest that this universal coupling constitutes a generic law of cell migration, which originates in the advection of polarity cues by an actin cytoskeleton undergoing flows at the cellular scale. Our analysis relies on a theoretical model that we validate by measuring the persistence of cells upon modulation of actin flow speeds and upon optogenetic manipulation of the binding of an actin regulator to actin filaments. Beyond the quantitative prediction of the coupling, the model yields a generic phase diagram of cellular trajectories, which recapitulates the full range of observed migration patterns.",
  "Damaging exercise invokes a series of widespread changes that impact many aspects of skeletal muscle physiology. When examining candidate intramuscular mechanisms, those associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, proteolysis and apoptosis appear to have garnered the most interest in the literature, but many aspects of these pathways remain in question. Due to the vast integrated network of signaling activities as well as the many known areas (and likely many unknown areas) of crosstalk throughout these mechanisms, in vivo research can be challenging. Currently, a relatively small number of studies have examined time-course related changes to blood-based markers of oxidative stress and even fewer have examined intramuscular changes using in vivo models. An equally small number of studies have examined intramuscular changes in apoptotic activity. While changes in other tissues hold importance, intramuscular adaptations and the mechanisms involved are of the highest importance for determining how skeletal muscle adapts and respond to stressful, damaging stimuli.

  "The aim of this study was to assess the potential benefits of inorganic nitrite in 2 clinical models: stress-induced myocardial ischemia and whole-arm ischemia-reperfusion.\nInorganic nitrite, traditionally considered a relatively inert metabolite of nitric oxide, may exert vasomodulatory and vasoprotective effects. Despite promising results from animal models, few have shown effectiveness in human model systems, and none have fully translated to the clinical setting.\nIn 10 patients with inducible myocardial ischemia, saline and low-dose sodium nitrite (NaNO\u2082) (1.5 \u03bcmol/min for 20 min) were administered in a double-blind fashion during dobutamine stress echocardiography, at separate visits and in a random order; long-axis myocardial function was quantified by peak systolic velocity (Vs) and strain rate (SR) responses. In 19 healthy subjects, flow-mediated dilation was assessed before and after whole-arm ischemia-reperfusion; nitrite was given before ischemia or during reperfusion.\nComparing saline and nitrite infusions, Vs and SR at peak dobutamine increased in regions exhibiting ischemia (Vs from 9.5 \u00b1 0.5 cm/s to 12.4 \u00b1 0.6 cm/s, SR from -2.0 \u00b1 0.2 s(-1) to -2.8 \u00b1 0.3 s(-1)), whereas they did not change in normally functioning regions (Vs from 12.6 \u00b1 0.4 cm/s to 12.6 \u00b1 0.6 cm/s, SR from -2.6 \u00b1 0.3 s(-1) to -2.3 \u00b1 0.1 s(-1)) (p < 0.001, analysis of variance). With NaNO2, the increment of Vs (normalized for increase in heart rate) increased only in poorly functioning myocardial regions (+122%, p < 0.001). Peak flow-mediated dilation decreased by 43% after ischemia-reperfusion when subjects received only saline (6.8 \u00b1 0.7% vs. 3.9 \u00b1 0.7%, p < 0.01); administration of NaNO2 before ischemia prevented this decrease in flow-mediated dilation (5.9 \u00b1 0.7% vs. 5.2 \u00b1 0.5%, p = NS), whereas administration during reperfusion did not.\nLow-dose NaNO\u2082 improves functional responses in ischemic myocardium but has no effect on normal regions. Low-dose NaNO\u2082 protects against vascular ischemia-reperfusion injury only when it is given before the onset of ischemia.",
  "Research capacity is a prerequisite for any health care institution intending to provide high-quality care, yet, few clinicians engage in research, and their work is rarely recognized. To make research an institutional activity, it could be helpful to measure health care professionals' research performance. However, a comprehensive approach to do this is lacking.\nWe conducted a literature analysis to determine how best to assess research performance. Our method was not restricted to bibliometric and citation parameters, as is usually the case, but also including \"hidden\" activities, generally not considered in research performance evaluations.\nA set of 12 easily retrievable indicators was used and corresponding points assigned according to a weighting system intended to reflect the effort estimated to perform each activity. We observed a highly skewed score distribution, with a minority of health care professionals performing well across the indicators. The highest score was recorded for scientific papers (768/1098 points, 70%). Twenty percent of researchers at our institution generated 50% of points.\nWe develop a simple method for measuring research performance, which could be rapidly implemented in health care institutions. It is hoped that the proposed method might be useful for promoting research and guiding resource allocation, although further evaluations are needed to confirm the method's utility.",
  "In Kasensero fishing community, home of the first recorded case of HIV in Uganda, HIV transmission is still very high with an incidence of 4.3 and 3.1 per 100 person-years in women and men, respectively, and an HIV prevalence of 44%, reaching up to 74% among female sex workers. We explored drivers for the high HIV transmission at Kasensero from the perspective of fishermen and other community members to inform future policy and preventive interventions.\n20 in-depth interviews including both HIV positive and HIV negative respondents, and 12 focus-group discussions involving a total of 92 respondents from the Kasensero fishing community were conducted during April-September 2014. Content analysis was performed to identify recurrent themes.\nThe socio-economic risk factors for high HIV transmission in Kasensero fishing community cited were multiple and cross-cutting and categorized into the following themes: power of money, risk denial, environmental triggers and a predisposing lifestyle and alcoholism and drug abuse. Others were: peer pressure, poor housing and the search for financial support for both the men and women which made them vulnerable to HIV exposure and or risk behavior.\nThere is a need for context specific combination prevention interventions in Kasensero that includes the fisher folk and other influential community leaders. Such groups could be empowered with the knowledge and social mobilization skills to fight the negative and risky behaviors, perceptions, beliefs, misconceptions and submission attitudes to fate that exposes the community to high HIV transmission. There is also need for government/partners to ensure effective policy implementation, life jackets for all fishermen, improve the poor housing at the community so as to reduce overcrowding and other housing related predispositions to high HIV rates at the community. Work place AIDS-competence teams have been successfully used to address high HIV transmission in similar settings.",
  "In crop improvement, the isolation, cloning and transfer of disease resistance genes (R-genes) is an ultimate goal usually starting from tentative R-gene analogs (RGAs) that are identified on the basis of their structure. For bread wheat, recent advances in genome sequencing are supporting the efforts of wheat geneticists worldwide. Among wheat R-genes, nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-encoding ones represent a major class. In this study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction-based approach to amplify and clone NBS-type RGAs from a bread wheat cultivar, 'Salambo 80.' Four novel complete ORF sequences showing similarities to previously reported R-genes/RGAs were used for in silico analyses. In a first step, where analyses were focused on the NBS domain, these sequences were phylogenetically assigned to two distinct groups: a first group close to leaf rust Lr21 resistance proteins; and a second one similar to cyst nematode resistance proteins. In a second step, sequences were used as initial seeds to walk up and downstream the NBS domain. This procedure enabled identifying 8 loci ranging in size between 2,115 and 7,653 bp. Ab initio gene prediction identified 8 gene models, among which two had complete ORFs. While GenBank survey confirmed the belonging of sequences to two groups, subsequent characterization using IWGSC genomic and proteomic data showed that the 8 gene models, reported in this study, were unique and their loci matched scaffolds on chromosome arms 1AS, 1BS, 4BS and 1DS. The gene model located on 1DS is a pseudo-Lr21 that was shown to have an NBS-LRR domain structure, while the potential association of the RGAs, here reported, is discussed. This study has produced novel R-gene-like loci and models in the wheat genome and provides the first steps toward further elucidation of their role in wheat disease resistance.",
  "Helminth infections as well as structural alternations in the long-terminal repeat (LTR) regions of HIV-1 are known to contribute to elevated HIV RNA level and enhance HIV-1 diseases progression. However, the impact of helminths infections on the occurrences of triple NF-\u03baB and genetic variability in LTR region of HIV-1C isolates is not known. We aimed to examine the presence of genetic variability in the LTR region of HIV-1C isolates during chronic HIV-helminth co-infection.\nHIV-1C infected Ethiopians with (n\u2009=\u200922) and without (n\u2009=\u200920) helminth infection were included. The LTR region of HIV was amplified and sequenced. Sequences were aligned with reference set from the Los Alamos HIV database. Phylogenetic analysis and frequency of polymorphic changes was performed by the neighbour-joining method using Geneious Basic software.\nAll LTR sequences from patients with or without of helminth co-infection clustered with HIV-1 subtype C with two distinct subclusters (C and C'). The enhancer element was found to have three copies of 10-base pair binding sites for NF-\u03baBs which is an evidence for predominance of triple NF-\u03baB sites (94%) in HIV-1C isolates irrespective of helminths co-infection and subclusters. Moreover, irrespective of helminth co-infection and C/C' subclusters high sequences similarity in LTR was observed. There was no significant difference in plasma HIV RNA level between HIV-1 C and C' subclusters.\nDespite the small sample size, the predominance of triple NF-\u03baB binding sites and high sequence similarities in LTR region irrespective of helminths infection suggest the natural occurrence of the three NF-\u03baB binding sites in HIV-1C isolates without the influence of secondary infection. Thus, the higher HIV-1C viraemia in helminth co-infected individuals is more likely a result of immune activation rather than LTR sequence variation. Moreover, the lack of significant difference in plasma HIV RNA level between HIV-1 C and C' subcluster may show the lack of functional differences among the two groups.",
  "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has advantages in showing pathologic changes of disc space infection, which is important in clinical treatment. The purpose of this study was to describe the MRI findings of disc space infections in relation to chronicity.\nMRI of 60 patients from January 1, 2002 to April 30, 2012 in Ottawa Hospital were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists blindly. All patients had histological confirmation, with 55 having microbiological confirmation as well. These patients were divided into acute (n = 18), subacute (n = 21) and chronic (n = 21) based on histological findings. The following potential signs of MRI finding were assessed: marrow edema, endplate erosions, disk fluid and height change, paraspinal mass, epidural collection, facet fluid and enhancement in the marrow, disc, paraspinal mass, and epidural involvement. Statistical analysis consisted of t- or F-tests and chi-square test.\nIn the 60 patients, 83 infected discs (single disc in 45 patients, 2-4 discs in 15 patients) were found, including 22 discs in the acute group, 30 discs in the subacute group, and 31 discs in the chronic group. There was a significant difference in the extent of marrow edema between the acute, subacute and chronic groups (P < 0.05), with a gradually increasing extent from acute to chronic. The extent of endplate erosions increased with chronicity, but was not statistically significant. There were significant differences in the disc fluid, epidural collection, and disc enhancement among the acute, subacute and chronic groups, as well as the facet fluid between acute and chronic groups (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the present probability of disc height loss, paraspinal mass, and marrow enhancement among the three groups (P > 0.05).\nFrom acute to chronic infections, the extent of marrow edema and endplate erosions appeared to gradually increase. Epidural collections and facet fluid are most frequently found in the acute group, while disc fluid and disc enhancement are more common in the chronic patients.",
  "Septic shock is a major healthcare problem. Adrenal insufficiency (AI) in children with septic shock is a recognized complication, yet is controversial regarding its management and effect on mortality. According to the current guidelines, children with risk factors for AI should receive a stress dose of steroids in step 3 of treatment. This study aimed to evaluate and compare early corticosteroid therapy with the traditional use of steroids among pediatric septic shock patients.\nThis prospective randomized interventional clinical study included 3 groups of patients (32 each) and was conducted in Alexandria University pediatric intensive care unit. By protocol, the first group received steroids in step 3 of the treatment according to the current international guidelines (group A), and the second group was managed as group A and was tested for AI by adrenal stimulation test using intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (cosyntropin) (group B). The third group received steroids at the start of fluid therapy (group C). A fourth group (group D) was created by adding patients from groups A and B who needed corticosteroids in the third stage of therapy according to the international protocol in 1 group. All patients were evaluated for basal serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations.\nThe data showed a statistically significant shorter shock reversal time among patients receiving corticosteroids at the start of treatment compared with those who received it at the third step of treatment (P = 0.046); however, mortality was not statistically different among the groups. In addition, there was no superinfection in cases receiving early steroid therapy.\nEarly use of corticosteroid in patients with septic shock might shorten the shock reversal time without increase in mortality or superinfection.",
  "Bovine babesiosis caused by the protozoan parasite, Babesia bovis, remains a significant cause of avoidable economic losses to the livestock industry in many countries throughout the world. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of severe disease in susceptible cattle are not well understood and the tools available to study the biology of the parasite, including technologies for genetic manipulation, have only recently been developed. Recent availability of multiple parasite genomes and bioinformatic tools, in combination with the development of new biological reagents, will facilitate our better understanding of the parasite. This will ultimately assist in the identification of novel targets for the development of new therapeutics and vaccines. Here we describe some recent advances in Babesia research and highlight some important challenges for the future.",
  "Providing support and talking to the relatives of organ donors is one of the most difficult tasks in an intensive care unit. The quality of this task, especially the quality of the conversation, can be significantly improved by exact and timely preparation as well as by the creation of the respective framework conditions and training in the area of communication.\nThe exact preparation includes knowledge about the patient and their relatives, their cultural and religious background, medical data, and the findings of examinations. An important aspect is the knowledge and the consideration of ethical differences in different cultures as well as overcoming language barriers with the help of an interpreter. Team meetings with the treating intensive care physician, the nursing staff, and the transplant coordinator ensure that all questions on the topic brain death and organ donation can be answered satisfactorily. At the beginning of the conversation, the uncomfortable news should be delivered. Only after the relatives have accepted the news about the death which can be recognized by their verbal and non-verbal statements should the doctor turn the conversation to organ donation.\nIn the conversation, openness, empathy, authenticity, emotional support as well as friendly/attentive conversation technique are important. Communication skills can be improved through seminars and regular training.",
  "Administrative health databases are valuable sources of data for conducting research including disease surveillance, outcomes research, and processes of health care at the population level. There has been limited use of administrative data to conduct studies of pediatric rheumatic conditions and no studies validating case definitions in Canada. We report a validation study of incident cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Cases identified through administrative data algorithms were compared to diagnoses in a clinical database. The sensitivity of algorithms that included pediatric rheumatology specialist claims was 81-86%. However, 35-48% of cases that were identified could not be verified in the clinical database depending on the algorithm used. Our case definitions would likely lead to overestimates of disease burden. Our findings may be related to issues pertaining to the non-fee-for-service remuneration model in Nova Scotia, in particular, systematic issues related to the process of submitting claims.",
  "Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a phosphorylated and \u03b3-carboxylated protein that has been shown to prevent the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in the walls of blood vessels. MGP is also expressed in kidney and may inhibit the formation of kidney stones, which mainly consist of another crystalline phase, calcium oxalate monohydrate. To determine the mechanism by which MGP prevents soft-tissue calcification, we have synthesized peptides corresponding to the phosphorylated and \u03b3-carboxylated sequences of human MGP in both post-translationally modified and non-modified forms. The effects of these peptides on hydroxyapatite formation and calcium oxalate crystallization were quantified using dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Peptides YGlapS (MGP1-14: Y\u03b3EpSHEpSMEpSYELNP), YEpS (YEpSHEpSMEpSYELNP), YGlaS (Y\u03b3ESHESMESYELNP) and SK-Gla (MGP43-56: SKPVH\u03b3ELNR\u03b3EACDD) inhibited formation of hydroxyapatite in order of potency YGlapS > YEpS > YGlaS > SK-Gla. The effects of YGlapS, YEpS and YGlaS on hydroxyapatite formation were on both crystal nucleation and growth; the effect of SK-Gla was on nucleation. YGlapS and YEpS significantly inhibited the growth of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals, while simultaneously promoting the formation of calcium oxalate dihydrate. The effects of these phosphopeptides on calcium oxalate monohydrate formation were on growth of crystals rather than nucleation. We have shown that the use of dynamic light scattering allows inhibitors of hydroxyapatite nucleation and growth to be distinguished. We have also demonstrated for the first time that MGP peptides inhibit the formation of calcium oxalate monohydrate. Based on the latter finding, we propose that MGP function not only to prevent blood-vessel calcification but also to inhibit stone formation in kidney. ",
  "Congenital Morgagni's hernia (CMH) is rare and represents less than 5% of all congenital diaphragmatic hernias. This is a national review of our experience with CMH outlining clinical presentation, methods of diagnosis, associated anomalies, treatment, and outcome.\nThe medical records of all patients with the diagnosis of CMH treated at four pediatric surgery units in Saudi Arabia were retrospectively reviewed for age at diagnosis, sex, presenting symptoms, associated anomalies, diagnosis, operative findings, treatment, and outcome.\nDuring a 20-year period (January 1990-December 2010), 53 infants and children with CMH were treated. There were 38 males and 15 females. Their age at diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 9 years (mean 22.2 months). Forty-three (81%) presented with recurrent chest infection. Twenty-two (44.5%) had right CMH, 15 (28.3%) had left-sided hernia and 16 (30.2%) had bilateral hernia. In 7, the diagnosis of bilaterality was made at the time of surgery. Associated anomalies were seen in 38 (71.7%). Twenty-one (39.6%) had congenital heart disease, 8 (15%) had malrotation, and 15 (28.3%) had Down syndrome. All were operated on. Twenty-nine (54.7%) underwent repair via an open approach. The remaining 24 (45.3%) underwent repair using minimal invasive surgery, laparoscopic-assisted hernia repair (19 patients) or totally laparoscopic approach (5 patients). At the time of surgery, the hernia sac content included the colon in 33 (62.3%), part of the left lobe of the liver in 13 (24.5%), the small intestines in 11 (20.75%), the omentum in 5 (9.4%), and the stomach in 4 (7.5%). In 12 (22.6%), the hernia sac was empty. When compared to the open repair, the laparoscopic-assisted approach was associated with a shorter operative time, an earlier commencement of feeds, less requirement for postoperative analgesia, a shorter hospital stay, and better cosmetic appearance. There was no mortality. On follow-up, 2 (7%) of the open surgical group developed recurrence.\nCMH is rare and in the pediatric age group commonly presents with recurrent chest infection and has a high incidence of associated anomalies, commonly congenital heart disease and Down syndrome. We advocate a laparoscopic-assisted approach to repair CMH. This is a simple technique that produces a sound repair, and when compared with the open approach it takes less operative time, requires less analgesia, allows earlier commencement of feeds, is associated with a shorter hospital stay, and has a better cosmetic outcome.",

  "This study aimed to find analytical data base for Iraqi phoenix date palm pruning woods, which produced by pruning process at the season of date palm production. Lignin has been extracted and purified for five types of Iraqi date palm using Klason lignin method. The weight of the extracted lignin ranged from 0.410 g to 0.720 g, and the lignin % ranged from 17.6 to 36. The other ingredients (waxes, oils, resin, and proteins of wood gums) % ranged from 20 to 29.5. FT-IR characterization showed that the (-OH) phenolic group appear in Ashrasi lignin structure only and disappear in other lignin samples, and the (4-O-5 inter monomeric lignin linkage) showed strong to moderate intensity peaks for all studied samples except the Austa omran sample has a weak intensity peaks. Also (DODO inter monomeric lignin linkage) showed strong intensity peaks for all studied samples except the Barban sample showed moderate intensity peaks. UV-vis characterization showed that the lowest absorption maximum (266 nm) corresponds to Barban lignin sample, while the highest absorption maximum (271 nm) corresponds to Sultani lignin sample.",
  "Prior trials with monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilizin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reported robust low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions. However, the ability to detect potentially beneficial changes in other lipoproteins such as lipoprotein (a), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and apolipoprotein (Apo) A1, and adverse events (AEs) was limited by sample sizes of individual trials. We report a pooled analysis from four phase 2 studies of evolocumab (AMG 145), a monoclonal antibody to PCSK9.\nThe trials randomized 1359 patients to various doses of subcutaneous evolocumab every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 4 weeks (Q4W), placebo, or ezetimibe for 12 weeks; 1252 patients contributed to efficacy and 1314, to safety analyses. Mean percentage (95% CI) reductions in LDL-C vs. placebo ranged from 40.2% (44.6%, 35.8%) to 59.3% (63.7%, 54.8%) among the evolocumab groups (all P < 0.001). Statistically significant reductions in apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and increases in HDL-C were also observed. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs with evolocumab were reported in 56.8 and 2.0% of patients, compared with 49.2% and 1.2% with placebo. Adjudicated cardiac and cerebrovascular events were reported in 0.3 and 0% in the placebo and 0.9 and 0.3% in the evolocumab arms, respectively.\nIn addition to LDL-C reduction, evolocumab, dosed either Q2W or Q4W, demonstrated significant and favourable changes in other atherogenic and anti-atherogenic lipoproteins, and was well tolerated over the 12-week treatment period.",
  "Aberrant regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is one of the major causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Loss-of-function mutations in APC are commonly found in CRC, leading to inappropriate activation of canonical Wnt signaling. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes are detected in up to 60% of CRCs. Whereas KRAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways are critical for intestinal tumorigenesis, mechanisms integrating these two important signaling pathways during CRC development are unknown. Results herein demonstrate that transformation of normal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) by oncogenic forms of KRAS, BRAF or MEK1 was associated with a marked increase in \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 and c-MYC promoter transcriptional activities and mRNA levels of c-Myc, Axin2 and Lef1. Notably, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of T-Cell Factor 4 (\u0394NTCF4) severely attenuated IEC transformation induced by oncogenic MEK1 and markedly reduced their tumorigenic and metastatic potential in immunocompromised mice. Interestingly, the Frizzled co-receptor LRP6 was phosphorylated in a MEK-dependent manner in transformed IECs and in human CRC cell lines. Expression of LRP6 mutant in which serine/threonine residues in each particular ProlineProlineProlineSerine/ThreonineProline motif were mutated to alanines (LRP6-5A) significantly reduced \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity. Accordingly, MEK inhibition in human CRC cells significantly diminished \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 transcriptional activity and c-MYC mRNA and protein levels without affecting \u03b2-catenin expression or stability. Lastly, LRP6 phosphorylation was also increased in human colorectal tumors, including adenomas, in comparison with healthy adjacent normal tissues. Our data indicate that oncogenic activation of KRAS/BRAF/MEK signaling stimulates the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which in turn promotes intestinal tumor growth and invasion. Moreover, LRP6 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 may provide a unique point of convergence between KRAS/MAPK and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalings during oncogenesis. ",
  "An 8-year-old boy with previous shunt operation for corrected transposition of great arteries, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis and multiple aortopulmonary collateral arteries underwent corrective surgery. In the early post-operative period, there were clinical findings of superior vena cava obstruction. Cardiac catheterization at 72 h following surgery showed a systemic venous baffle stenosis between the vena cava and right atrium. A stent was successfully implanted in the vena cava percutaneously, and the stenosis was relieved. Her symptoms resolved in a short time period, and she was extubated rapidly. During the follow-up, excellent maintenance and patency of systemic venous baffle were observed. ",
  "Although thalamic deep brain stimulation is an effective treatment for patients with essential tremor, little is known about its effect on cortical neural dynamics. Therefore, we investigated long-range temporal correlations and spectral power in electroencephalographic recordings of patients during OFF versus ON bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation in comparison with healthy controls. Cortical dynamics were analyzed in the range of 6-30 Hz. We found the presence of long-range temporal correlations up to 20 s in patients and controls. Thalamic deep brain stimulation was associated with increased long-range temporal correlations in the high beta band (21-30 Hz) and decreased power in the low beta band (13-20 Hz) compared with OFF stimulation and healthy controls. Long-range temporal correlations in the 6-10 Hz range were increased with OFF stimulation compared with the controls. Importantly, deep brain stimulation-induced changes in long-range temporal correlations within 6-10 Hz and in the beta ranges (13-20, 21-30 Hz) were correlated with OFF-ON changes in the tremor severity and with the disease duration, respectively. The differential reactivity of long-range temporal correlations and spectral power to deep brain stimulation might suggest that both measures reflect distinct aspects of cortical dynamics and might represent biomarkers for stimulation-induced modulations of neural dynamics in electroencephalography. The fact that long-range temporal correlations, but not spectral power, were correlated with clinical information might suggest long-range temporal correlations as a potential marker for disease severity in essential tremor.

  "Recurrent or metastatic lung cancer is difficult to manage. This retrospective study aimed to assess the efficacy of repeated iodine-125 seed implantations combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for locally recurrent or metastatic stage-III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nEighteen previously treated stage-III/IV NSCLC patients with local or metastatic recurrences underwent 1-to-3 iodine-125 implantations. Six of these patients received palliative EBRT and six patients received combined chemotherapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin. Near-term treatment efficacy was evaluated 3\u00a0months after seed implantation by comparing changes in tumor size on computed tomography images; the evaluated outcomes were complete response, partial response, stable disease, and local tumor control rate. Long-term efficacy was assessed based on 1- and 2-year survival rates.\nPatients were followed up for 6 to 50\u00a0months. The overall (i.e., complete\u2009+\u2009partial) response rate was 87.4\u00a0%. The local control rates after the first, second, and third years were 94.1, 58.8 and 41.2\u00a0%, respectively.\nThe results of this study demonstrated that repeated implantation of radioactive particles combined with EBRT is a safe treatment that effectively controlled local recurrence and metastasis of stage III/IV NSCLC.",
  "Among patients with large colorectal sessile polyps or laterally spreading lesions, it is important to identify those at risk for submucosal invasive cancer (SMIC). Lesions with overt endoscopic evidence of SMIC are referred for surgery, although those without these features might still contain SMIC that is not visible on endoscopic inspection (covert SMIC). Lesions with a high covert SMIC risk might be better suited for endoscopic submucosal dissection than for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). We analyzed a group of patients with large colon lesions to identify factors associated with SMIC, and examined lesions without overt endoscopic high-risk signs to determine factors associated with covert SMIC.\nWe performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients referred for EMR of large sessile or flat colorectal polyps or laterally spreading lesions (\u226520 mm) at academic hospitals in Australia from September 2008 through September 2016. We collected data on patient and lesion characteristics, outcomes of procedures, and histology findings. We excluded serrated lesions from the analysis of covert SMIC due to their distinct phenotype and biologic features.\nWe analyzed 2277 lesions (mean size, 36.9 mm) from 2106 patients (mean age, 67.7 years; 53.2% male). SMIC was evident in 171 lesions (7.6%). Factors associated with SMIC included Kudo pit pattern V, a depressed component (0-IIc), rectosigmoid location, 0-Is or 0-IIa+Is Paris classification, non-granular surface morphology, and increasing size. After exclusion of lesions that were obviously SMIC or serrated, factors associated with covert SMIC were rectosigmoid location (odds ratio, 1.87; P\u00a0= .01), combined Paris classification, surface morphology (odds ratios, 3.96-22.5), and increasing size (odds ratio, 1.16/10 mm; P\u00a0= .012).\nIn a prospective study of 2106 patients who underwent EMR for large sessile or flat colorectal polyps or laterally spreading lesions, we associated rectosigmoid location, combined Paris classification and surface morphology, and increasing size with increased risk for covert malignancy. Rectosigmoid 0-Is and 0-IIa+Is non-granular lesions have a high risk for malignancy, whereas proximally located 0-Is or 0-IIa granular lesions have a low risk. These findings can be used to inform decisions on which patients should undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection, EMR, or surgery. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT02000141.",
  "To perform prediction analysis between topographic, pachymetric and wavefront parameters in keratoconus, suspects, and normal cases and to look at the possibility of a unified equation to evaluate keratoconus.\nThis cross-sectional, observational study was done in cornea services of a specialty hospital. Fifty eyes of 50 candidates with a diagnosis of normal, keratoconus suspect, and keratoconus were included in each group (total 150 eyes). All eyes underwent detailed analysis on Scheimplug + Placido device (Sirius, CSO, Italy). Main parameters evaluated were topographic [maximum keratometry (Max Km), average keratometry and astigmatism at 3, 5, and 7\u2009mm], pachymetric [central and minimum corneal thickness (MCT) and their difference, corneal volume] and corneal aberrations [higher order aberrations root-mean-square (HOARMS), coma, spherical, residual].Central tendency, predictive fits and regression models, were computed.\nThe measured variables had a significant difference in mean between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Max Km, MCT, and HOARMS had significant fits with other topographic, pachymetric and wavefront parameters, respectively. Inter-relations between these three (Max Km, MCT, and HOARMS) were also stronger for keratoconus (R(2) from 0.75 to 0.33) compared to suspect/normal eyes (R(2) from 0.15 to 0.003). These three variables (Max Km, MCT and HOARMS) were used as representative variables to create the unified equations. The equation for the pooled data was (Kmax\u2009=\u200959.5\u2009+\u20092.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009HOARMS-0.03\u2009\u00d7\u2009MCT; R(2)=\u20090.7, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nMajor variables used for grading keratoconus (MaxKm, MCT, HOARMS) can be linked by linear regression equations to predict the pathology's behavior.",
  "Whipple's disease is considered an infection of middle-aged white men of European ancestry. Cases are rare and disproportionately associated with occupational exposure to soil or animals.

In MtFs, rates of working in jobs which do not require high education level, unemployment, being a sex worker (p < 0,001), drug use (p = 0,017), and not having the health insurance (p < 0,001) were found to be significantly higher than FtMs. Rates of receiving psychotherapy for gender dysphoria (p = 0,001) and starting hormone therapy under the supervision of a doctor (p < 0,001) were significantly higher in FtMs, however higher rates of taking hormone therapy (p < 0,001) and undergoing surgery for sex reassignment (p < 0,001) were observed in the MtFs.\nThere are significant differences both in sociodemographic characteristics and clinical characteristics between MtFs and FtMs. However further studies would be needed to identify underlying causes.",
  "In the present work, we constructed a new label-free \"inter-sandwich\" electrochemical aptasensor for thrombin (TB) detection by employing a cleavage-based hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The designed single-stranded DNA (defined as binding DNA), which contained the thrombin aptamer binding sequence, a DNAzyme cleavage site and a signal reporter sequence, was first immobilized on the electrode. In the absence of a target TB, the designed DNAzymes could combine with the thrombin aptamer binding sequence via complementary base pairing, and then Cu(2+) could cleave the binding DNA. In the presence of a target TB, TB could combine with the thrombin aptamer binding sequence to predominantly form an aptamer-protein complex, which blocked the DNAzyme cleavage site and prevented the binding DNA from being cleaved by Cu(2+)-dependent DNAzyme. As a result, the signal reporter sequence could leave the electrode surface to trigger HCR with the help of two auxiliary DNA single-strands, A1 and A2. Then, the electron mediator hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride ([Ru(NH3)6](3+)) was embedded into the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to produce a strong electrochemical signal for the quantitative measurement of TB. For further amplification of the electrochemical signal, graphene reduced by dopamine (PDA-rGO) was introduced as a platform in this work. With this strategy, the aptasensor displayed a wide linearity in the range of 0.0001 nM to 50 nM with a low detection limit of 0.05 pM. Moreover, the resulting aptasensor exhibited good specificity and acceptable reproducibility and stability. Because of these factors, the fabrication protocol proposed in this work may be extended to clinical application. ",
  "An 82-year-old man underwent radiotherapy (brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy) for prostate cancer, followed approximately five years later by endocrine therapy for biochemical recurrence, which controlled the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. His later admission due to severe gross hematuria and dysuria is described. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed a cystic tumor continuous with the prostate between the prostate and rectum, and this tumor was thought to be the cause of the hematuria and dysuria. Transrectal biopsy and transurethral resection of the prostate were performed for pathological diagnosis and improvement of dysuria. The pathological diagnosis was remnant prostate cancer, and the cystic tumor was thought to have developed as a result of prostate cancer recurrence. Although chemotherapy using docetaxel was considered postoperatively, the patient refused this treatment. Even though the PSA level was under control, the patient's condition progressed rapidly, with onset of pulmonary and cervical lymph node metastases within a short period of time, and the patient subsequently died.",
  "This paper reviews the classification of periodontal-endodontic lesions and considers the pathways through which inflammatory lesions or bacteria may communicate between the pulp and the periodontium. Such communications have previously underpinned the classification of periodontal-endodontic lesions but a more up-to-date approach is to focus specifically on those lesions that originate concurrently as pulpal infection (and necrosis) and periodontal disease on the affected teeth. In doing so, both conventional periodontal and endodontic treatments are indicated for the affected teeth, although more complex management strategies may occasionally be indicated. ",
  "Blood transfusion plays a prominent role in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but causes significant iron overload. As transfusions are used to treat the severe complications of SCD, it remains difficult to distinguish whether organ damage is a consequence of iron overload or is due to the complications treated by transfusion. Better management has resulted in increased survival, but prolonged exposure to iron puts SCD patients at greater risk for iron-related complications that should be treated. The success of chelation therapy is dominated by patient adherence to prescribed treatment; thus, adjustment of drug regimens to increase adherence to treatment is critical. This review will discuss the current biology of iron homeostasis in patients with SCD and how this informs our clinical approach to treatment. We will present the clinical approach to treatment of iron overload at our centre using serial assessment of organ iron by magnetic resonance imaging.",
  "Decompressive craniectomy (DC)--a potentially life-saving intervention following traumatic brain injury (TBI) with medically refractory brain swelling--once performed, surviving patients, more often than not, undergo a second procedure with cranioplasty (CP) in the future. This study analyzes complications following CP after DC, as the beneficial effects of the DC can't be extrapolated in long run over a population unless one adds into it the complications associated with the CP in the survivors of TBI.\nAn observational study was performed retrospectively, with the review of case records. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected, and complications were studied for any predictive parameters. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors that influenced these complications.\nData were collected for a total of 74 patients who underwent CP with a median age of 32, and a mean follow-up time of 2 years and 8 months. The mortality rate was 1.35% and overall complication rate 31%. The most significant factor determining complications were operating time more than 90 min Odds ratio (OR) 4.77 (1.61-14.20); timing of CP less than 3 months after craniectomy, OR 2.86 (1.48-8.11); age more than 20 years, OR 2.59 (1.20-6.53); and female gender, OR 1.91 (1.13-4.17).\nAlthough considered as a straight-forward procedure, the risks associated with this elective procedure should be kept in mind by the surgeon so that the patients and families can be apprised judiciously. It should be ascertained that patient and/or family consents for the procedure after being appropriately informed about the benefits and risks associated with the procedure.",
  "The emergence of hypervirulent resistant strains have made Clostridium difficile a notorious nosocomial pathogen and has resulted in a renewed interest in preventive strategies, such as vaccines based on (synthetic) cell wall antigens. Recently, the structure of the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of this species has been elucidated. Additionally, this LTA was found to induce the formation of protective antibodies against C. difficile in rabbits and mice. The LTA from C. difficile is isolated as a microheterogenous mixture, differing in size and composition, impeding any structure-activity relationship studies. To ensure reliable biological results, pure and well-defined synthetic samples are required. In this work the total synthesis of LTAs from C. difficile with defined chain length is described and the initial biological results are presented. ",
  "To evaluate the performance of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted single shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) imaging of the liver in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in reference to the LI-RADS classification system.\nMR images of 40 patients with 68 LI-RADS grade 3-5 lesions were analyzed. Two readers independently reviewed sequences and characterized lesion signal intensity, followed by consensus evaluation. CE-MRI served as reference standard. Sensitivities were compared across sequences. Lesion-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured and compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test across sequences and the Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis test between LI-RADS categories. Inter-reader variability was assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic.\nConsensus sensitivities of LI-RADS 3-5 lesions using SSFSE images versus DWI were similar (0.53-0.63, p=0.089), however, the sensitivity with DWI b=700 was higher (0.63) than DWI b=0 (0.53, p=0.039). Lesion-to-liver CNRs were larger for all DWI sequences compared to SSFSE images (p<0.001 for all). ADCs of large (>2cm) LIRADS 3-5 lesions were lower than those of small lesions (1.09\u00b10.33 vs. 1.31\u00b10.26, p=0.02), however lesion ADCs were not different from those of adjacent hepatic parenchyma for any LI-RADS lesion.\nDWI has a similar sensitivity compared to SSFSE, but intensity on DWI likely represents intrinsic T2 signal hyper-intensity rather than restricted diffusion as the ADC values were not lower than adjacent parenchyma. Therefore it may not be appropriate to consider hyper-intensity on high b-value as a separate ancillary criteria to T2 hyper-intensity in LI-RADS.",
  "Macular degeneration (MD) can cause a central visual field defect. In a previous study, we found volumetric reductions along the entire visual pathways of MD patients, possibly indicating degeneration of inactive neuronal tissue. This may have important implications. In particular, new therapeutic strategies to restore retinal function rely on intact visual pathways and cortex to reestablish visual function. Here we reanalyze the data of our previous study using surface-based morphometry (SBM) rather than voxel-based morphometry (VBM). This can help determine the robustness of the findings and will lead to a better understanding of the nature of neuroanatomical changes associated with MD.\nThe metrics of interest were acquired by performing SBM analysis on T1-weighted MRI data acquired from 113 subjects: patients with juvenile MD (JMD; n = 34), patients with age-related MD (AMD; n = 24) and healthy age-matched controls (HC; n = 55).\nRelative to age-matched controls, JMD patients showed a thinner cortex, a smaller cortical surface area and a lower grey matter volume in V1 and V2, while AMD patients showed thinning of the cortex in V2. Neither patient group showed a significant difference in mean curvature of the visual cortex.\nThe thinner cortex, smaller surface area and lower grey matter volume in the visual cortex of JMD patients are consistent with our previous results showing a volumetric reduction in their visual cortex. Finding comparable results using two rather different analysis techniques suggests the presence of marked cortical degeneration in the JMD patients. In the AMD patients, we found a thinner cortex in V2 but not in V1. In contrast to our previous VBM analysis, SBM revealed no volumetric reductions of the visual cortex. This suggests that the cortical changes in AMD patients are relatively subtle, as they apparently can be missed by one of the methods.",
  "Locomotor adaptations to a novel environment can be measured through changes in muscle activity patterns and lower limb kinematics. The location and mechanisms underlying these adaptive changes are unknown. The purposes of the current study were (1) to determine whether corticospinal tract (CST) excitability is altered by resisted walking and (2) to ascertain whether changes in cortical excitability are muscle specific. Forty healthy participants walked with a robotic gait device (Lokomat) that applied a velocity-dependent resistance against hip and knee movements during walking. CST excitability was assessed by quantifying motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately before and after baseline and resisted walking. MEPs were measured in either the biceps femoris (BF) or the rectus femoris (RF). Recruitment curves were collected by stimulating in 5 % increments from 105 to 145 % of active motor threshold. Results demonstrated a significant increase in MEP amplitude in the BF following baseline walking in the Lokomat. The RF did not demonstrate these changes. There was no further change in MEP size following resisted walking in either muscle group. These results suggest that locomotion increases CST excitability in a muscle-specific fashion. As such, it may be important for determining how to enhance the central nervous system's ability to integrate adaptive strategies during walking.",
  "Imepitoin has recently been approved in Europe for the management of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. Currently, there is no evidence-based information available on the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs used as additions to the therapeutic regimen in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy that are not well controlled with imepitoin. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of phenobarbital or potassium bromide (KBr) as add-on antiepileptic drugs for controlling dogs refractory to a maximum dose of imepitoin (30\u2009mg/kg twice daily). The study was performed as a prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial. The efficacy of phenobarbital and KBr was evaluated by comparing monthly seizure frequency (MSF), monthly seizure day frequency (MSDF), the presence of cluster seizures during a retrospective 2-month period with a prospective follow-up of 6 months, and the overall responder rate. Twenty-seven dogs were included in the study, 14 dogs in the phenobarbital group and 13 dogs in the KBr group. Both median MSF and MSDF decreased in the phenobarbital group (both P\u2009=\u20090.001) and in the KBr group (P\u2009=\u20090.004 and P\u2009=\u20090.003, respectively). Overall, the number of dogs with cluster seizures decreased (P\u2009=\u20090.0005). The responder rate was 79% vs. 69% in the phenobarbital and KBr groups, respectively. We conclude that phenobarbital or KBr add-on treatment decreases median MSF and MSDF in epileptic dogs refractory to a maximum dose of imepitoin. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated and resulted in an improvement in seizure management in the majority of the dogs.",
  "A facile and efficient synthesis of chromen-4-one and isoflavone frameworks is achieved by the domino C-acylation/O-acylation/aldolization sequence. This operationally simple one-pot elegant strategy provides structurally unique chromen-4-ones and isoflavones directly from phenols via concomitant formation of multiple C-C and C-O bonds in a single operation. The outcomes of the buttressing effect, substituent dependence, and catalyst and solvent specificity during the course of the Friedel-Crafts acylation reactions are demonstrated and supported by fitting experiments.

  "Using several complementary analytical methods, we demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Tz), diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride can be stored in polyolefin infusion bags at 4\u00b0C or room temperature up to 6 months with no evidence of chemical or physical instability. No aggregation of Tz was observed and its three dimensional structure remains unaltered. Thus, the practical use of diluted Tz can be safely extended to optimize the workload of centralized preparation units and to minimize costs.",
  "Concerns have been raised regarding the human health effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), many of which are associated with and leaching from plastics. As infants are particularly vulnerable to EDCs, we have investigated whether plastic teethers for babies represent a relevant source of exposure. Applying effect-directed analysis, we use bioassays to screen teethers, toys used to soothe a baby's teething ache, for endocrine activity and chemical analysis to identify the causative compounds. We detected significant endocrine activity in two of 10 plastic teethers. Those samples leached estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic activity as detected in the Yeast Estrogen Screen and Yeast Antiandrogen Screen. After sample fractionation, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry non-target screening revealed that methyl-, ethyl- and propylparaben were responsible for the observed estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity in one product. The second product is likely to contain at least six different antiandrogenic compounds that remain so far unidentified. This study demonstrates that plastic teethers can be a source of infant exposure to well-established and unknown EDCs. Because of their limited value to the product, but potential toxicity, manufacturers should critically revisit the use of parabens in plastic teethers and further toys. Moreover, plastic teethers might leach EDCs that escape routine analysis and, thus, toxicological evaluation. The resulting uncertainty in product safety poses a problem to consumers, producers and regulators that remain to be resolved.",
  "Peripartum cardiomyopathy remains a rare but troubling complication of pregnancy. The cardiovascular stress of labour and delivery may lead to cardiac decompensation. These patients require special anaesthetic care during labour and delivery. Compensated patients may undergo vaginal delivery with appropriate monitoring. For those patients late in pregnancy with more significant haemodynamic compromise, consideration should be given to elective caesarean section with invasive haemodynamic monitoring of the mother. We report two antenatal cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy where a near miss situation was avoided by doing an emergency caesarean section.",
  "To investigate the dissemination potential of a Tai Ji Quan-based program, previously shown to be efficacious for reducing risk of falls in older adults, through outpatient clinical settings.\nA single-group pre/post design in which participants attended a twice-weekly Tai Ji Quan training program for 24 weeks.\nCommunities in Lane County, Oregon.\nIndependently living individuals (N=379) aged 65 and older.\nUsing the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework, the primary outcome was the proportion of participating healthcare providers who made referrals. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of referred individuals agreeing to participate and enrolling in the program, and measures of program implementation, maintenance, and effectiveness (on measures of falls, balance, gait, physical performance, and balance efficacy).\nOf the 252 providers invited to participate, 157 made referrals (62% adoption rate). Of 564 individuals referred, 379 (67% reach) enrolled in the program, which was successfully implemented in senior and community centers with good fidelity, 283 completed the program (75% retention), and 212 of these attended 75% or more of the 48 sessions. Participants reported a reduction in falls, with an incidence rate of 0.13 falls per person-month, and showed significant improvement from baseline in all outcome measures. A 3-month postintervention follow-up indicated encouraging levels of program maintenance among providers, participants, and community centers.\nHealthcare providers successfully implemented a protocol to refer individuals at risk of falling to a Tai Ji Quan-based program. The evidence-based program appears readily scalable and exportable, with potential for substantial clinical and public health effect.",
  "The first major attempts to categorize psychiatric disorders in the United States occurred in the mid-1800s, when census data were collected that included \"insanity\" and \"idiocy\" of household members. In Europe, Florence Nightingale promoted the use of non-fatal disease classification for morbidity and treatment in 1860. By the late 1800s, Kraepelin categorized disorders, and his sixth edition of the Compendium der Psychiatrie was widely adopted by both Europeans and Americans. In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association published the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Since then, the manual has been periodically updated, expanded, and edited to reflect social and scientific beliefs about the etiology and categorization of psychiatric illness and care. In this article, we explore the historical and ongoing development of the DSM and its implications for psychiatric nurses.",
  "Inflammation has been defined for many years as the response to tissue injury and infection. We are now forced to reconsider this definition by the avalanche of reports that molecules and cells associated with inflammation are activated or expressed in high concentration in a large variety of states in the absence of tissue injury or infection. Modest increases in concentration of C-reactive protein, a circulating marker of inflammation, have been reported to be associated with an astounding number of conditions and lifestyles felt to be associated with poor health; these conditions represent or reflect minor metabolic stresses. In recent years we have learned that inflammation is triggered by sentinel cells that monitor for tissue stress and malfunction-deviations from optimal homeostasis-and that molecules that participate in the inflammatory process play a role in restoring normal homeostasis. Accordingly, we suggest that inflammation be redefined as the innate immune response to potentially harmful stimuli such as pathogens, injury, and metabolic stress.-Antonelli, M., Kushner, I. It's time to redefine inflammation.",
  "Cancer cell migration requires the regulation of actin networks at protrusions associated with invadopodia and other leading edges. Carcinomas become invasive after undergoing an epithelial-mesenchymal transition characterized by the appearance of vimentin filaments. While vimentin expression correlates with cell migration, the molecular connections between vimentin- and actin-based membrane protrusions are not understood. We report here that CARMIL2 (capping protein, Arp2/3, myosin-I linker 2) provides such a molecular link. CARMIL2 localizes to vimentin, regulates actin capping protein (CP), and binds to membranes. CARMIL2 is necessary for invadopodia formation, as well as cell polarity, lamellipodial assembly, membrane ruffling, macropinocytosis, and collective cell migration. Using point mutants and chimeras with defined biochemical and cellular properties, we discovered that localization to vimentin and CP binding are both essential for the function of CARMIL2 in cells. On the basis of these results, we propose a model in which dynamic vimentin filaments target CARMIL2 to critical membrane-associated locations, where CARMIL2 regulates CP, and thus actin assembly, to create cell protrusions.

  "Protein aggregation leading to formation of amyloid fibrils is a symptom of several diseases like Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes and so on. Elucidating the poorly understood mechanism of such phenomena entails the difficult task of characterizing the species involved at each of the multiple steps in the aggregation pathway. It was previously shown by us that spontaneous aggregation of hen-eggwhite lysozyme (HEWL) at room temperature in pH 12.2 is a good model to study aggregation. Here in this paper we investigate the growth kinetics, structure, function and dynamics of multiple intermediate species populating the aggregation pathway of HEWL at pH 12.2. The different intermediates were isolated by varying the HEWL monomer concentration in the 300 nM-0.12 mM range. The intermediates were characterized using techniques like steady-state and nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence, atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Growth kinetics of non-fibrillar HEWL aggregates were fitted to the von Bertalanffy equation to yield a HEWL concentration independent rate constant (k\u200a=\u200a(6.6 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10(-5) s(-1)). Our results reveal stepwise changes in size, molecular packing and enzymatic activity among growing HEWL aggregates consistent with an isodesmic aggregation model. Formation of disulphide bonds that crosslink the monomers in the aggregate appear as a unique feature of this aggregation. AFM images of multiple amyloid fibrils emanating radially from amorphous aggregates directly confirmed that on-pathway fibril formation was feasible under isodesmic polymerization. The isolated HEWL aggregates are revealed as polycationic protein nanoparticles that are robust at neutral pH with ability to take up non-polar molecules like ANS.",
  "Hepatitis C infection is a global health problem. Most infected children have not been identified. Perinatal transmission is the most common mode of acquisition. Liver disease owing to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection progresses slowly in individuals infected early in life. Serious complications rarely affect patients during childhood. Successful treatment of HCV in adults has improved and recommendations have changed. Treatment in children should be deferred until direct-acting antivirals and interferon-free regimens are available to this population. If treatment cannot be deferred, regimens including peginterferon and ribavirin can be given to children with compensated liver disease. ",
  "The plant family Amaryllidaceae is known for its horticultural and ornamental appeal as well as its medicinal value. In relation to these characteristics, trade in Amaryllid flower varieties (especially daffodils) is a multi-million dollar revenue generator for the floriculture industry. Of greater significance are the medicinal attributes of the family, which has already spawned the Alzheimer's prescription drug galanthamine, a potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, of significance in the progression of neurodegeneration associated with motor neuron diseases, with annual global sales of around $150 million. Furthermore, it is anticipated that an anticancer drug target related to the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid pancratistatin, presently under advanced clinical evaluation, will enter commercial circulation within the next decade. Members of the Amaryllidaceae are distributed through both tropical and subtropical regions of the globe, but are of prominence within three distinct geographical locations, including Andean South America, the Mediterranean basin, and southern Africa. The southern African zone is known to harbor at least a third of the worldwide complement of around 1000 species, many of which are widely utilized in the traditional medicinal practices of the indigenous people of the region. Given its therapeutic and economic value, its natural abundance in the southern African region, coupled to its widespread usage in ethnic medicine, the family Amaryllidaceae provides a diverse and accessible platform for phytochemical based drug discovery. A consolidation of its traditional usage as well as its chemical and pharmacological profiles will thus guide efforts aimed at maximizing this potential. In undertaking this survey of the Amaryllidaceae of southern African, we aimed to achieve these goals.",
  "Management of penetrating trauma to the paranasal sinuses with retained foreign bodies represents a challenge due to the proximity to vital neurovascular structures.

  "Amygdalin is a fruit-derived glycoside with the potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This study was designed to identify the neuroprotective and neuritogenic activities of amygdalin. We initially demonstrated that amygdalin enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuritogenesis and attenuated 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in rat dopaminergic PC12 cells. To define protein targets for amygdalin, we selected a total of 11 mostly regulated protein spots from two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels for protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. We verified the effect of amygdalin on six representative proteins (i.e., calreticulin, Hsp90\u03b2, Grp94, 14-3-3\u03b7, 14-3-3\u03b6/\u03b4 and Rab GDI-\u03b1) for biological relevance to neuronal survival and differentiation. Calcium-binding chaperone calreticulin is of special interest for its activities to promote folding, oligomeric assembly and quality control of proteins that modulate cell survival and differentiation. We transiently knocked down calreticulin expression by specific siRNA and studied its effect on the neuroprotective and neuritogenic activities of amygdalin. We found that amygdalin failed to enhance NGF-induced neuritogenesis in calreticulin-siRNA transfected cells. On the other hand, amygdalin rescued 6-OHDA-induced loss of calreticulin expression. We also found that amygdalin increased the intracellular calcium concentration possibly via inducing calreticulin. Collectively, our results demonstrated the role of calreticulin in mediating the neuroprotective and neuritogenic activities of amygdalin. ",
  "To determine the relationship between maternal blood pressures throughout pregnancy and the risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate.\nWomen were prospectively enrolled at 9-14 weeks and had serial blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy. SGA prevalence was compared to maternal blood pressure at enrollment, average blood pressure during each trimester, and blood pressure trends throughout gestation. Blood pressure was categorized as normotension, prehypertension, or hypertension using Joint National Committee on Hypertension-7 (JNC-7) definitions. Information on preeclampsia prevalence was also obtained due to its frequent concurrence with SGA.\nA total of 758 women had 8438 blood pressure measurements taken (average 11.1, range 3-14) and 65 (8.6%) delivered an SGA neonate. Forty-two of 514 (8.2%) normotensive women at enrollment and 23/244 (9.4%) women with enrollment prehypertension or hypertension delivered an SGA neonate. Women with persistent hypertensive range blood pressures had an SGA rate 2-3 times higher than other women (p = 0.272) as well as a significantly higher preeclampsia rate (p < 0.001). Women with elevated enrollment blood pressures did not have an increased SGA rate if their blood pressures improved throughout pregnancy. Logistic regression identified enrollment uterine artery Doppler, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A levels, and ethnicity as primary contributors to SGA.\nBlood pressure improvement throughout pregnancy decreases the preeclampsia rate without increasing SGA frequency. Theoretical risks of fetal growth delay should not prevent investigations into improved maternal blood pressure control, possibly at thresholds lower than commonly used in obstetric practice, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy.",
  "To discuss the feasibility and advantages of aberrant incision location of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery(VATS) in different gender when treating some lung diseases.\nRetrospectively analyze the clinical data of these patients who were received lung partial resection from the same surgeon in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, the 100 Hospital of PLA, Wu Zhong People's Hospital from January 2012 to December 2014. Among the males, 57 were undertook a single-port VATS surgery through areola incision (Observation Group A), and the rest 114 were received conventional uniportal VATS surgery (Control Group A). Among the females, 15 were operated through the subxiphoid incision (Observation Group B) and 45 were received conventional one (Control Group B). The operation time, blood loss, postoperative drainage amount, chest tube drainage duration, postoperative hospital stay, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score of the 1st and 2nd postoperative day, the incision discomfort in the 30th and 90th postoperative day, and the incision satisfaction degree were evaluated.\nAll the patients were underwent total VATS surgery successfully and no severe complications were observed.In males, there were no significant differences in operation time, blood loss, postoperative drainage amount, chest tube drainage duration, postoperative hospital day and the VAS score of the 1st postoperative day (P>0.05). Compared to control group A, the VAS score of the 2nd postoperative day was lower (3.5 \u00b1 1.78 vs 4.14 \u00b1 1.62, P=0.035), the incision discomfort of 30th and 90th postoperative day was reduced (33 (57.9%) vs 86 (75.4%), P=0.019; 29 (50.9%) vs 76 (66.7%), P=0.046) and the incision satisfaction degree was significantly improved (45 (79.0%) vs 61 (53.5%), P=0.001). In females, there were no statistical differences in intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage amount, chest tube drainage duration, postoperative hospital day and the incision satisfaction degree (P>0.05). Compared to control group B, the operation time was obviously prolonged (57.67 \u00b1 5.72 vs 42.91 \u00b1 7.82, P=0.000), the VAS score of the 1st and 2nd postoperative day was significantly lower (2.13 \u00b1 1.06 vs 3.84 \u00b1 1.69, P=0.001; 2.60 \u00b1 1.24 vs 4.18 \u00b1 1.56, P=0.001) and the incision discomfort in 30th and 90th postoperative day was reduced (4 (26.7%) vs 34 (75.6%), P=0.001; 4 (26.7%) vs 28 (62.2%), P=0.017).\nIn single-port VATS surgery for some pulmonary diseases, we choose \"individualized\" incision location--trans-areola incision in males and subxiphoid incision in females--according to different gender and varieties of diseases, which was considered to raise incision satisfaction degree in males and reduce postoperative pain in females, it warrants further clinical practice.",
  "Andromonoecy, the presence of hermaphrodite and male flowers in the same individual, is genetically fixed or induced, e.g. by fruit set. Little is known about the forces triggering andromonoecy in the Apiaceae. In the present study, a natural population of the protandrous Chaerophyllum bulbosum was investigated to elucidate architectural constraints and effects of resource reallocation.\nThree sets of plants (each n = 15) were treated by hand pollination, pollinator exclusion and removal of low-order inflorescences. Fifteen untreated plants were left as controls.\nUntreated plants produce umbels up to the third branch order, with increasing proportions of male flowers from 15 % (terminal umbel) to 100 % (third-order umbels). Fruit set correspondingly decreases from 70% (terminal umbel) to <10 % (second-order umbels). Insignificant differences from hand-pollinated plants do not reveal any sign of pollinator limitation at the study site. Bagged individuals show the same increase in male flowers with age as untreated plants, indicating that the presence of andromonoecy is not induced by fruit set. After umbel removal, individuals tend to present a higher number of hermaphrodite flowers and fruits in the umbels of second and third order. Three plants (25 %) produced an additional branch order composed of 100 % male umbels.\nInherited andromonoecy and the plastic response to environmental conditions are interpreted as a self-regulating system saving investment costs and optimizing fruit set at the same time.",
  "Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a chronic condition of unknown etiology. MCS is characterized by recurrent nonspecific symptoms from multiple organ systems in response to chemical exposures in concentrations that are normally tolerated by the majority of the population. The symptoms may have severe impact on patients' lives, but an evidence-based treatment for the condition is nonexisting. The pathophysiology is unclarified, but several indicators point towards abnormal processing of sensory signals in the central nervous system. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) offer a promising new treatment for refractory depression and can be targeted at the brain, thereby activating biochemical cell processes.\nIn a parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Danish Research Centre for Chemical Sensitivities, the effects of PEMF in MCS patients will be assessed using the Re5 Independent System. Based on sample size estimation, 40 participants will be randomized to either PEMF therapy or placebo. The allocation sequence will be generated by computer. All involved parties (that is, participants, investigators, the research nurse, and the statistician) will be blinded to group allocation. The participants will receive PEMF therapy or placebo applied transcranially 30 minutes twice a day for 7 days a week over 6 consecutive weeks. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, once weekly during treatment, post treatment, and at 2.5-month and 4.5-month follow-up according to a predefined timetable. The primary outcome will be a measurement of the impact of MCS on everyday life. The secondary outcomes will be measurements of MCS symptoms, psychological distress (stress, anxiety or depressive symptoms), capsaicin-induced secondary punctate hyperalgesia, immunological markers in serum, and quality of life.\nThis trial will assess the effects of PEMF therapy for MCS. Currently, there is no treatment with a documented effect on MCS, and in terms of healthcare there is very little to offer these patients. There is thus a great need for well-conducted randomized trials aimed at assessing possible treatment effects. A positive outcome will pave the way for improved healthcare and understanding of this very disabling and overlooked condition.\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01834781.",
  "Ayurvedic preparations achieved paramount importance in contemporary life owing to the safety and efficacy when compared with those of synthetic drugs. But due to lack of proper standardization at each stage from starting to culmination results in inferior quality and less demand. Saraswataristam, a fermented ayurvedic preparation, has been employed for treating central nervous system disorders and dermatological problems. Saraswataristam, containing Centella asiatica (L) urban (Umbelliferae) as the major ingredient is prepared as per the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeial specifications, characterized and standardized for determining the quality, safety and efficacy of herbs used in it. Saraswataristam was prepared and subjected to phytochemical screening by FTIR analysis and HPTLC fingerprinting, heavy metal determination by AAS, determination of alcohol content, test for E. coli, S. aureus, aerobic bacteria, yeasts and mould, oral toxicity studies and anti-epileptic activity by MES method. The physico-chemical studies showed total ash content as 1.1%, extractive values and some trace elements such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium and Arsenic with 3.1, 0.047, 0.17 and 0.46 ppm respectively and all values are found within the acceptable limits specified by WHO. FTIR and HPTLC studies showed the presence of asiaticoside in Saraswataristam, resulting in its chemical standardization. The formulation showed signs of dose dependent significant (P<0.001) reduction in various episodes of epileptic seizures in comparison with standard phenytoin, thereby making it biologically standardized. The physico-chemical and pharmacological analysis to standardize Saraswataristam confirmed its use as a safe anti-epileptic ayurvedic formulation. ",
